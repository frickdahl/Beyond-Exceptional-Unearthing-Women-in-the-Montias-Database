On 24 November 1636, Jannetge (Immetgen) Vincken, widow of Claes Bas, assisted by her brother (in-law) Pieter Bas (II), named Phillip Vincon (cited in the NOTES to R 24944 of Montias2) to collect money for wines delivered (NA 843, fol. 1389, Not. Hoogeboom).  She was buried in Amsterdam on 10 July 1637. Claes Bas was the son of Pieter Jacobsz. Bas (1566-1633), grain dealer and merchant, who was associated with Hans van Loon of R 7696 of Montias2, and of Maria Overlander. Claes Bas left 100,000 f. to his heirs. Maria Bas, the daughter of Claes Bas and Immetgen Vinck, baptized on 29 May 1633, married Dr. Jan Deyman on 19 November 1658 (Anatomy lesson by Rembrandt). He was the son of Wolphert Deyman, sea captain, and Maria Troncquoy (Elias, Vroedschap, pp. 250-1). For Jan Deyman's death inventory, see INVNO 452 of 23 March 1668.  Maria Troncquoy was probably the daughter of Jan Tronquoij of INVNO 955. Cornelis de Graef, cited in the INTRO, was commissary for small affairs in 1631 and captain of the militia in 1642. Frans Banning Cocq was the captain of the company portrayed in Rembrandt's Night Watch.","Inventaris van sekere meublen bij wijlen Claes Bas in sijn leven coopman binnen deser stede, ende Immetge Vinck des selfs huijsvrouw metter doot ontruijmt ende naergelaten, bevonden ter laester woonplaetse vande voors.

Aert de Conincx I died shortly before 24 December 1602 when Jan Gerritsz. Vriesenborch, as husband and guardian of Susanna Coninx I; Hans Caluwaert as having married AbigaÃ«l Coninx; and Daniel Coninx I, for themselves and in the place of Aert Conincx II (den jongen); and as guardians of the children of minor age of Neeltgen Coninx, all heirs of Aert Coninx den Ouden (I), drew up a procuration in Dordrecht (Bredius, KÃ¼nstler-inventare, p. 34 of NachtrÃ¤ge). On 12 March 1619, Pieter and Aert de Coninck, uncles, together with Hans Calvaert (Caluwaert), uncle by marriage, of the children left by Daniel Coninck, married to Susanna de Moor, declared that these children had inherited f. 405:12:-- in cash and a house located in Dordrecht (Orphan Chamber appearance cited by Briels, Vlaamse schilders, p.348). This document proves that Pieter de Coninck I and Aert de Coninck I were brothers (both uncles of the children of Daniel de Coninck I). Hans Caluwaert signed the Remonstrant petition of 1628.   Aert de Conincx II (called de oude after his father's death and after his son Aert de Conincx III had passed his childhood),  a jeweller, was the father of the painters Jacob and Philips de Conincx (Coning), of the jewellers Aert de Coning III and of Daniel de Coning (II), of David de Conincx, who shipped beer from Amsterdam to Rotterdam (see below) and at one time  worked for the V.O.C., and of Pieter de Coning II, called merchant in a deposition by Abraham Furnerius (the Rembrandt pupil) of 13 June 1643 (Bredius, op.cit. pp.1644-5). On 7 March 1642, David de Coningh, beer shipper from Amsterdam to Rotterdam, Jacob de Coningh, painter in Rotterdam, and Daniel de Coningh, diamond polisher (diamantslijper) sold for 2,300 f. their half share in a house on the East side of the Keisersgracht, between the corner house of Abraham Stoffels and the house of the notary Barend Jansz. Verbeeck (Bredius, op.cit. p.1369).  Besides these six sons, Aert de Conincx II had two daughters, Jannetje and Maria de Coning. It was probably at the request of Pieter de Coning II (the son above-named) that the first inventory cited in the INTRO was drawn up. He should not be confused with Pieter (de) Coning I, goldsmith and jeweller, of R 28901 of Montias2. It is not clear how Paulijntje van Beusecom, the daughter of Hans van Beusecom of R 21330, baptized on 28 December 1606 (DTB 4/184), who also claimed some goods in the inventory, including her own portrait at R 1809 of Montias2,  was related to the Conings. She may possibly have been the wife of Pieter de Coning II. The painter  Salomon de Koninck was Pieter (de) Coning I's son. If Pieter (de) Coningh I  was the brother of Aert Conincx I and of Daniel Conincx I, which is possible in view of his standing surety for Daniel in 1608 (R 27979 of Montia2), then Salomon was the cousin of Aert de Conincx's six sons. In 1607, Aert de Conincx II was called diamond cutter (diamantsnijder) (Van Dillen, Bronnen tot de geschiedenis van het bedrijfsleven, R.G.P., 69(1929), p. 641). He was married to Anneken de Moor (Bredius, op.cit. p.156).  On 22 January 1630, Aernout Konincx (undoubtedly identical with Aert de Conincx II) and his wife (unnamed), together with Aert, Maria, and Pieter de Koninck  were invited to the wedding of Bernard de Moor and Clara van Capelle and there to ask also after Philips and Janneken Konincx (who were also presumably related, even though Philips was only 10 years old) (Nederlandse Leeuw, 44(1926), col. 9). David de Moor, who was also invited, seems to have been the brother of Bernard de Moor. He later became the guardian of the children of Aert de Coninck. (Both were undoubtedly related to Aert's wife Anneken de Moor, but the precise relation could not be ascertained). In 1631, Arent Conincx (II), living on the Keysersgracht, paid a tax of 100 f. (Kohier, fol. 97vo, p. 23). Aert de Coninck (II)  was buried on 28 March 1639 (DTB 1100A/33). On 23 March 1640, Jacob Valckenier brought 3,800 f. to the Orphan Chamber on behalf of the children and heirs of Aert (de) Koningh, jeweler, and his wife, among whom were two children of minor age, Philips, 20, and Daniel, 22 (on whom see below).  They inherited a number of assets, among which was their father's  house on the Keysersgracht (West side), which lay next to that of alderman Joris Jorisz. (Backer) (of R 8340 of Montias2). On 19 February 1641, Philips, being already married, received 1,500 f. from his guardians Jacob Valckenier and David de Moor (WK 5073/789). On 9 September 1641, Jacob Coning, painter, living in Rotterdam, and David Coning sold to Maillaert Brest a third part in their late father's house on the West side of the Keizersgracht. On 25 November of the same year, Daniel Coning, diamond polisher, sold to the same Brest (cited in the TEXT of R 1112 of Montias1)  another sixth part; the brothers Aert, Pieter, and Philips Coning sold the other half of the house on 28 January 1642 (Oud Holland 1(1883), p. 305).  Aert de Conincx II left a widow named Cornelia Tambaert, who sold her brother-in-law Pieter Coningh II, the sixth part in two houses on the Prinsengracht (ibid.)   On 2 May 1647, sinjeur Jacob de Coninck, painter, living in The Hague, sold Francoys Strick in Amsterdam the sixth part in some jewels which were deposited with his brother Pieter (II) there (ibid. p.307). Aert Coningh III was baptized as an adult in the Remonstrant church on 31 October 1641. The insolvent inventory of Cornelia Tambaert, the widow of Aert Coningh II, was taken on 22 February 1647.  She lived on the Prinsengracht daer de Roode Robijn Ring uijthangt (DBK 5072/352). Daniel Conincx II, who was 22 in 1640, was born circa 1618. He cannot therefore be identical with Daniel Coning I (of R 27979 of Montias2), who was the beneficiary of an obligation issued in 1611 (cited in the INTRO). It was probably Daniel Coning II who settled in England and was the father of Daniel Coning III who was born about 1668 (when his father was already 50). Daniel III became a pupil of his granduncle Jacob Coningh, the son of Aert de Conincx II, in Denmark in 1690 (Bredius, op.cit. p. 166).  David Questier, one of the witnesses to the present inventory, was the son of Salomon Davidsz. Questier, pumpmaker, from Leiden. He was 14 years old in 1637 and thus only 16 at the time he signed the inventory. He was the brother of Petronella Questier who married the architect Philips Vingboons (of R 20143) on 21 April 1645. He was a dealer in lead. He was buried on 17 April 1663 (Oud Holland 27(1909), pp. 198-200). Jan Colijn (II), cited in the INTRO, was probably the son of Jan Colijn I of INVNO 758. He was born about 1591 (see the TEXT of R 661).","Inventaris van sekere meublen gemaeckt ten versoecke ende op't aengeven van Sr. Pieter Conings , de welcke verclaerde d'selve hem in eijgendom to competeren , item van verscheijde meublen de welcke Paulintje van Beusecum (so sij verclaerde) te behoren, sijnde bij ijder partije die sij sustineert van den overledene te schenck ontfangen ofte gecocht hebben, sulcx express[elijck] genoteert.

On 21 December 1613, Anthoni Gailliart de jonge was betrothed to Maaike Abeels (DTB 763/24). On 12 October 1614, he and his wife Mayke Abeels had their son Anthony baptized in the O.K. in the presence of Anthonij Galjaert (I) and Grietje Abeels (DTB 5/119). On 3 August 1617, the same parents had their son Steven baptized in the O.K. in the presence of Nikolaes Abeels and Josijntje Bincken (Bencken)  (DTB 5/223). Nikolaes Abeels and  Jonas Abeels, cited in the INTRO, may have been Mayke's brothers. On Jonas Abeels, who married Anna Rueland, see Elias, Vroedschap van Amsterdam, p. 572.

Govert Gaillard was the brother of Anthony Gaillard de jonge. On his son Joan, see the NOTES to R 22087.  On 18 May 1641, a few paintings and drawings belonging to Anthony Gaillard (II), not included in the present inventory, were assessed. These are recorded in INVNO 1630.

Santvoort. For the post-mortem inventory of Maritje Coerten, see INVNO 371.  On 29 July 1636, the eerbare Maria Schoonmans, passed a testament in which she made the following bequests: to her brother Claes Schonemans, 1000 f. (and to his children after him); to her sisters Cornelia and Stijntje, each 100 f. and no more (sonder meer); and to the eersame Outger Pietersz. Spiegel (of R 27584), 1000 f. (and also to his children in case of his decease). She added that Outger Pietersz. was discharged from all the guarantees (borgtochten) he had given in her favor. He was also named executor of her testament, which was passed in his house. She named Sijtge Sijmons, widow of Guilliaem Hendricksz., her goede bekende, as universal heir. Outger Pietersz. was named as the executor of her testament (NA 642, film 4953, Not. Sybrant Cornelissen, fol. 204-206). On 25 June 1638, Lysbeth Cornelis, spinster, living in the Ronde Bagijnhof, 45 years old, made a deposition at the request of Hendrick Schut, clock maker, as curator, along with Jan van Herenbergh, of the insolvent (desolate) estate of Maritgen Schoonemans, who had also lived in the Ronde Bagijnhof. She declared that, after Maritge Schoonemans had left her residence three days before Palm Sunday 1637, to the prejudice of her creditors, about 3 days before the following May in the same year, the wife of Claes Felten, being the sister of Maritge Schoonemans, came to the house (of Maritge Schoonemans) in the aforesaid Hoff, and, in several trips, took away the movable goods (inboel)  of Maritge Schoonemans (NA 522, film 4861, Not. Westfrisius). The sister was of course Stijntje Schoonemans, the wife of Claes Felt. On 12 July 1638, Annetge Hessels, 69, widow of Martin Parijsz, declared at the request of Henrick Schut and Jan van Hardenburgh, as curators of the desolate estate of Maritge Schonemans, that they had been invited by Alexander Benyn and his wife Cornelia Schonemans to view a certain string of pearls which she (Maritge Schonemans) had asked to sell, which they did. Claes Felt had also been asked to sell some pearls for her (NA 992, film 1221, fol. 3). The cruycifix in de bedstede in the achtercamer is taken as evidence of Maritge Schonemans Roman Catholicism.

He may have been the son of the old Noirot whose portrait, together with his wife, was recorded in an anonymous inventory dated 10 July 1618 (NA 611, film 330, Not. Pieter Ruttens).  Lucas van Uffelen (1586-1638), at whose house some of  the goods in this inventory were found, spent part of his life in Venice where he assembled a collection of paintings. After his death (before 9 April 1638), a sale of a cargaison of his paintings was sold by the Orphan Chamber in his house on the Keisersgracht at the corner of the Westermarckt, which brought a total of 59,456 f. (Strauss, Rembrandt Documents, p. 177.) Jacomo (or Jacques) van Uffelen (1590-1640) was a merchant chiefly active in the Levant (R 7706).

Adriaen Noirot (II?), was  married to Susanna de Wilhem, who was apparently Elisabeth de Wilhem's sister. He  was the father of Jacob Noirot, baptized on 19 June 1629.

These appeared as the Historisch verhael alder ghedenk-weerdichste geschiedenissen. In 1624 and 1625, he reported on the latest news on tulips, which he apparently admired, and on the temperament of tulip lovers (Goldgar, Tulipmania, typescript, 2004, pp. 187-8).

Jacob and Nicolaes Jacobsz.) On 2 June 1635, three wool weavers declared at the request of Dirck Jansz. van Dorsten that they had very well known the petitioner. Two of them said that the petitioner (van Dorsten) had worked and lived in the house of Jan Arentsz. van Naerden where he supervised the wool cloth business (Van Dillen, Bronnen tot de geschiedenis van het bedrijfsleven 144(1974), p.90). Dirck Jansz. van Dorsten was perhaps the brother of the painter Jacob Jansz. van Dorsten (a pupil or epigone of Rembrandt)  and of the schipper op Rotterdam Matheus van Dorsten, whose inventory was published by Bredius (KÃ¼nstler-inventare, pp. 712-5). Jacob (Jacobus) van Dorsten was the brother-in-law of Geertruyt van Gherwen, from Leiden, a relative of the Rembrandt pupil Reynier van Gherwen (ibid.)   On 28 August 1636, Melis Willemsz. (illiterate), 36, a worker in the wool mill belonging to Jan and Claes Arentsz. van Naerden and Jan de Bruijn van Berendrecht, declared at the request of the latter, that he (Melis Willemsz.) had not been able to live on the wages that he had been paid, as he had said to Claes van Naerden (NA 597, fol. 521, Not. Lamberti).  On 13 October 1636, the honorable  Jan Arentsz. van Naarden declared that he had sold to a merchant in Gorcum 3 bales of wool weighing 750 pounds (NA 414A). He was buried on 9 February 1637  in the N.K. A sum of 8 f. was paid to the church on his behalf, which defrayed the cost of ringing the bells, as was the custom for Roman Catholics. The wooden crucifix above the bedstead in his inventory confirms that he was R.C. His brother Claes Arentsz. van Naarden, a sugar refiner and merchant, was a creditor, together with Rembrandt and some other individuals, of Hendrick Uylenburgh in 1640 (Strauss, Rembrandt Documents, p. 185). He was said to be 55 years old and a dealer in wool (wollehandelaer)  in a deposition dated 24 December 1633 concerning some defective wool deposited in a warehouse (NA 694B, film 4980, Not. J. Warnaerts). He was thus the younger brother of Jan Arentsz.   Arent van Naarden, who was surely related to Jan and Claes Arentsz. van Naarden (perhaps Jan's son), was a cloth merchant, according to a deposition of 15 February 1639 (NA 921, Not. B. Verbeeck).",Specificatie van allen den huysraet imboel schilderyen silverwerck ende clederen nagelaten by z.

Brechten ten Berch was the sister of Catarina ten Berch, the wife of Hendrick Bouwer, of INVNO 735. Hendrick Laurensz. remarried with Diewer Jans van Marcken (1573-1647).

Paspoort, was betrothed to Aaltje Jonckheijn, from Amsterdam, 30, assisted by her mother Adriana Coolhaas (DTB 431/473). Aaltje Jonckheijn was the daughter of Adriana Coolhaes (or Cools) and of Elbert Sijmonsz. Jonckheijn of INVNO 572. Delff apparently remarried with Brechtge Ariaens, who survived him. He paid a tax of 100 f. in 1631, at which time he lived on the West side of the Keizersgracht (Kohier fol. 95, p.23).  In an act of 13 April 1633, he was called koopman (NA 371, film 189, Not. W. Cluyt).  On 14 April 1637, the honorable Jan Arentsz. Delff, 41, sick and ready to die, made a declaration (NA 597, Not. Lamberti). On 22 June 1637, Aeltge Hermans, widow of Abel Andriesz., declared at the request of Brechtje Ariaens, widow of Jan Arentsz. Delff, that Jan Ariaensz. Delff, in his last sickness, had begged that his goods should not be sold but that they should be appraised (getaxeert) by two sworn appraisers. Aeltge had said: But that is not in the testament. Delff had answered that it should be done as if it had been stipulated in the testament. He had begged his nephew Arent Vapour to see that this would be done, and Vapour had given Delff his hand to signal that he would do so (NA 598, fol. 249-250). Arent Hendricksz. Vapour, born in Rotterdam, was the son of the painter Hendrick Arentsz. Vapour, who married in Delft in 1614 (Oud Holland 31(1913), p.261).  On 9 September 1646, Arent Vapour, living in 's Gravesande, made a declaration in Monster in which he stated that he was the sole heir of his uncle Jan Arentsz. Delff, who had died in Amsterdam. He named Hendrick de Slange in 's Gravesande to acknowledge in his name that David Janz. IJpelaer, merchant in Amsterdam, as substituted guardian of him, Vapour, in place of Hendrick Swart, burgomaster of Medemblick, had produced a proper accounting of his administration (Monster, ONA 6037 # 1019, kindly communicated by Gerard van Eendenburg). David Jansz. IJpelaer was the brother of Gabriel, Paul, and Jasper IJpelaer (see the TEXT of INVNO 264).   Jan Arentsz.  was the brother of Claes Arentsz. Delff, who, on or about 26 Marck 1635, acknowledged owing 200 f. Lyntgen Ariaens, daughter of [...] Ariaens. Claes Adriaensz. said he would keep the money until she married (NA 991, fol. 34vo).  There are three panels by Hendrick Vapour in the inventory plus eight small panels van Arees vader (also presumably Hendrick Vapour). Some goods were sold at the request of Jan Arentsz. Delff (and of Cornelis and Arent van der Wolff) on 23 April 1627 (INVNO 588 of R 489). Among the books in the present inventory: Psalmboeck, Testament met root leer, Groot Dordrecht Bijbel.","Specificatie van allen den huijsraet achtergelaten by Jan Arentsz.

Note that a second inventory, without prices, was recorded by the same notary on 25, 26, and 27 September 1636 of Eva Vinck's possessions. The paintings contained in the second inventory that were not recorded in the first are listed at the end of the present inventory. On 8 May 1627, Andries de Graeuw (II), from Amsterdam, no parents, assisted by Lambert van Dalen, living on the Heeregracht, was betrothed to Eva Vinck, from Amsterdam, 22, assisted by her father Willem Vinck and her mother Maria Opschoor (DTB 670/249). Eva's father Willem, who is known to have been a witness at a baptism held in the Lutheran Church, may have been Lutheran (see the Notes to R 20081 of Montias2). Andries de Graeuw II  and Eva Vinck, on 12 June 1633, had their child Maria baptized. The witness was Adriaen Boermans (DTB 41/255). Adriaen Boermans is likely to be the individual who prepared the accounting for the Orphan Chamber  for the estate of Andries de Grauw de oude in May 1626 (WK 5073/1191 and R 27304 of Montias2). On 25 April 1625, Andries de Grauwe (II) signed an agreement with other liefhebbers van de Nederduytsche Poesy to subsidize the poet Jan Jansz. Starter (Bredius, Oud Holland, 3(1885), p. 54). In January 1630, Andries de Graeuw (de jonge)  named Susanna van Dalen (his aunt ?) in Utrecht to collect money due to him by Roelandt Savery (Briels, Zuidnederlandse immigratie, p. 294). He paid a tax of 400 f. in 1631, at which time he lived on the Singel (Kohier, fol. 11vo.) Andries de Graeuw II was buried on 14 January 1636 (DTB 1054/94).","Inventaris van den inboel, clederen juwelen ende clenodien van wijlen Eva Vinck, weduwe van wijlen Andries de Graeuw, geweesde echteluijden gelijck  die selve nae het overlijden der voorn.

Hoolesloot, 21, living on the O.Z. Voorburgwal, assisted by his grandfather Andries Hollesloot, was betrothed to Marie Jacobs, 21, living in the Calverstraet, assisted by her parents (DTB 660/201).  On 10 September 1610, the Orphan Chamber named Jan Claesz. Hollesloot as guardian over the children of his sister Lysbeth Claes Hollesloot (WK 5073/513, fol. 138). On 5 December 1618, Meynert Jansz., tax master for bulk wares (grove waren), insinuated Jan Claesz. Hollesloot and other stone dealers and sculptors, summoning them to declare the amount of stones they had in stock. Hollesloot declared that he 17 great tombstones (sarcken) of blue stones (NA 391, fol. 542).  On 4 September 1624, the honorable Jan Claesz. Hollesloot declared at the request of Willem van Hasdonck that he had guaranteed (been borg for) a shipment of gun powder to the King of Sweden (NA 389, fol. 92).  Jan Claesz. Hollesloot, who had lived bij het Waterspoorts bruggetie, was buried on 10 October 1625. 23 f. were paid to the O.K. for his burial.  The tolling of the bells ordered for his burial indicates that he was Roman Catholic (DTB 1033/123). The presence in the inventory of a portrait of pater Jan Naij (or Ney) and one of Spinola in the inventory confirms that the couple were Roman Catholic. According to Mr. Sebastian Dudok van Heel, the last name of Marry Jacobs was Roost. Lysbeth Claes Hollesloot, the sister of Jan Claesz. Hollesloot, married Jacob Pietersz. Codde (Roman Catholic) on 2 June 1616. She was assisted by her swagerinne Maria Jacobs, the owner of the goods in this inventory (R 8318 of Montias2). On 24 November 1617, Cornelis Dankertsz., city mason, 45, Jan Claesz. HollesLoot, 28, and Claes Adriaensz. van Delft, 40, made a deposition (NA 351B, film 6406, Not. W. Cluyt). Claes Adriaensz. van Delft, mason, was the brother of Dirck Ariaensz. van Delft (of INVNO 509) and of Pieter Ariaensz. van Delft, sculptor, cited in the NOTES to R 21468. Claes and Pieter van Delft were apprenticed as mason/sculptors to Hendrick de Keyser (Ann Adams, he Paintings of Thomas de Keyser, Ph.D. Dissertation, p. 21).  In the 1629  inventory of the goods left by Jacomijntje Pieters, the widow of the sculptor Cornelis van der Blocke, a debt of 10 f. owed to Jan Claesz. Hollesloot, stone dealer, was recorded (INVNO 631).   In 1631, one year after the present inventory was taken, the heirs of Jan Claesz. Hollesloot, living on the N.Z. Achterburchwal, paid a tax of 100 f. (Kohier, fol. 289vo, p. 66). Jacob Hollesloot, the son of Jan Claesz., born about 1614, married Aef (Eva) Plemp, the daughter of Cornelis Gysbrechtsz.

Voorburgwal, was betrothed to Judith Jans, 20, living there also. She was illiterate (DTB 411/376). On 9 November 1604, Michel Persoij and Judith Jans had their daughter Francijn baptized in the N.K. in the presence of Hester Jans (DTB 39/51). On 27 November 1615, Michel Persoij and Judith Watus had their son Michiel baptized in the French Church in the presence of Isaac Punile and Jenne de Morge (DTB 130/18). On 26 January 1620, Michel Persoij and Judith Persoij had their daughter Marije baptized in the French Church  in the presence of Jerosme (Jeronimo)  Hostier and Caterine Giart (DTB 130/97). On 13 March 1636, Judit Jans, widow of Michiel Persoy, cook, declared at the request of Griet Jans, that she had given Elsgen Jans, the mother of Griet Jans, 25 f. for a year's rent (NA 911, Not. Eyloff). On 11 September 1637, Judith Persoij, widow of Michiel Persoy and Harmen Hendricksz., tailor, signed a contract of appreticeship (as a cook) for Harmen's son Jan for 5 years in her shop. No money was paid for the apprenticeship (NA 1185, fol. 133, Not. J. de Vos). Judith Persoij was  buried in the F.K. on 2 November 1638 (DTB 1130/77). Pelgrum van Hooft, who was said to be the grandfather of Sara and Pietie Perseijn (perhaps the children from a first marriage of Michiel Perseijn), was a buyer at auction (R 20353 of Montias2).  Michiel Persoij II, baptized in 1615, was betrothed to  Elisabeth van Diemen, daughter of Jochem van Dien (or Diemen), of R 23405 of Montias2, on 27 October 1644 (DTB 461/162). Pieter Persoy, master cook, who took on an apprentice on 2 May 1634, was probably the child Pieter cited in the INTRO (Van Dillen, Bronnen tot de geschiedenis van het bedrijfsleven R.G.P. 144(1974), p. 52). Jannetje Persoij, the daughter of Michiel and Judith Persoij, signed a pre-nuptial contract with Pieter Danielsz. Plantius (assisted by his grandfather Carel Lenartsz. I, probably of INVNO 640 and by her uncle Hendrick van Rossum) on 18 January 1634. She was assisted by her mother Judith Persoij and her swager Philip Bartelsz. (probably the son of Bartelt Philipsz. of R 27378). In case the bridegroom were to die first, the bride-to-be was slated to receive 600 f. (NA 911, film 1147, Not. Pr. Lodewycx). On 8 December 1648, the honorable Jan Jansz. Somer and Lambert Lucas Raningh declared that Job Teunis and Hans Meus had guaranteed the disbursement of  a sum of 800 f. that Laurens Meus, caffawercker in Amsterdam, had received from the hands of Nicolaes Cocques (of R 20336 of Montias2), pursuant to a sentence of the aldermen, which sum was coming from Judith Jans, widow of Michel Persoij (NA 1599, fol. 55, Not. Willem Hasen). Among the books in the present inventory: Expositie Calvini, Sleydanus, and Het loff des kerckes. These books suggest that Michiel Persoij I was Reformed (Calvinist).","Staet ende inventaris van den boedel goederen van wylen Judith Jans weduwe van Michiel Perseijn gelijck  sij de selve metter doot ontruijmt heeft ende naer haer overlyden bevonden is, beschreven door mij notaris ... ter requisitie van Mr. Nicolaes Coccus ende Aert de Haes als executeurs van de testamente van de voors.

It was perhaps his father of the same name who, in 1595, together with Cornelis van Lockhorst, Ludwig Koenig (in Basel), and Dietrich Krassert (in Strassburgh), had formed a paper-making company in Amsterdam, although the actual paper was produced in Basel (Th. Laurentius, Paper in the Netherlands in Fresh Woods and Pastures New: Seventeenth-century Dutch Landscape Drawings from the Peck Collection, Exh. Cat. Un. of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, N.C., p. 30.) Cornelis van Lockhorst, the principal partner, known as pampierverkoper (see the NOTES to R 25092), died in 1617. On 24 May 1631, Albert Jason, merchant in Amsterdam, appeared before the aldermen of Monster (near Delft). He refused, by reason of conscience, to give an oath (RA Monster 103, # 338, kindly communicated by Gerard van Eendenburg). He may therefore have been a Mennonite.  On 7 January 1634, Albert Tjason was insinuated by Roelandt van der Perre (perhaps the brother of Balthasar van der Perre (of R 8218 of Montias2). Roelandt van der Perre was administrator of the Compagnie der Duijtsche pampieren (NA 409, film 487, Not. Jacob and Nicolaes Jacobsz.) This insinuation may be related to the insolvency that led to the making of the present inventory. This insolvency may also be related to a suit waged by the widow and the heirs of Philips van Kazele against Tiason. P.C. Hooft intervened with the Eerste Raedt in the Hooghen Raede, on behalf of the widow (letter to Rochus van der Honart, Briefwisseling van Pieter Corneliszoon Hooft, vol. 2, p. 529). On 16 July 1636, Albert Tjason, as husband and guardian of Paschina van den Straten, together with Anna van den Strate, spinster, and Franchoys van der Strate, for themselves and as holders of a procuration from their mother Maycken Jans van Noucken(?), all heirs of their brother David van der Straten, went to the house of Samuel Sautijn, where Juffr. Sara Munnincx, widow and holder of the estate of Jan van der Straten (of R 27080) was living,  and, in her absence, insinuated her son, also named Jan van der Straten,  as follows. Sara Munnincx should procure an inventory of the goods left by David van der Straten (left with Jan van der Straten I), along with the accounts and other papers pertaining to David van der Straten's estate. Jan van der Straten II said he acknowledged the insinuation on his mother's behalf and asked for a copy of it (NA 889, film 595). Samuel Sautijn was a very rich merchant who traded in the Levant. On 20 June 1602, he married Maria van der Straten, daughter of Jan Fransz. van der Straten (of R 27080) and of Sara Monx (Munnincx), cited above. Montias2.

There were  many items of copper ware in the warehouse, including a large croon (multi-branch candelaber)  evaluated  at 30 f, a small one at 4 f, chandeliers etc..  Two inventories were drawn up of Abraham de Marees's possessions, the first, without evaluations, on 23 November 1631, the second , with prices, on 27 May 1632. The paintings in this second inventory were assessed by Francois Venant (I)  who was said to be overman van't schildersgilde. The records in Montias2 are based chiefly on the second inventory with some additions from the first, as noted. Abraham de Marez I, son of Jan de Marez I (1517-1603), initially passementwercker (lace worker),  then merchant in silk goods, married Maria Gemaert, daughter of Jean Gemaert and Maria Sturms, on 16 February 1627 (Jaarboek C.B.G. 44(1990)). The following insinuation, dated 9 July 1625, refers to the time when he was dealing in silk goods. Jan Baptista de Wael, insinuant, summoned Abraham de Marees to pay for eight bales of raw Moscow silk, which he had bought together with Coenradt de Wilde (II) (Van Dillen, Bronnen tot de geschiedenis van het bedrijfsleven R.G.P. 78(1933), pp. 576-7). He died on 12 November 1631. He lived in an expensive house in the Warmoesstraet, near the Lange Kercksteech (NA 563A). Abram's brother Daniel de Marez married Jenne Hurter (born in Middelburg about 1573), on 30 June 1595. His nephew, Jan Danielsz. de Marez, son of the preceding, married Christina Segers, the daughter of Jasper Segers of R 20521, and, after her death, Elisabeth de Schilder, daughter of Pieter de Schilder (of R 27188) and of Elisabeth Cobbaut (daughter of Aernout Cobbaut II of R 21250). Jan de Marees Danielsz., merchant, was said to be 40 years old in a deposition he made at the request of Jonas Abeels (cited in the TEXT of R 79)  concerning a ship on 16 November 1637 (NA 695B, Not. J. Warnaerts).   His other brother Nicolaes de Marees was the putative father of Sara de Marees I of INVNO 1207. Abraham de Marez II, the son of Abraham de Marez I, was a merchant on the Nieuwendijk. He married, first, Sara de Coster, and then, on 5 June 1626, Rebecca Hooghkamer. He drew up his testament on 18 July 1635, leaving 64,000 f. to his three children with his first wife Sara (de) Coster and 36,000 f. to his three children with Rebecca Hoochcamer. The six children were named universal heirs (for the rest). Jan (Abrahamsz.) de Marees was guardian of the children of the first bed, Jacob Pietersz. Hoochcamer of the children of the second bed. Jacob Hoochcamer was the testator's father-in-law, the father of Rebecca  (NA 21, film 41, fol. 21 vo., Notary Salomon Henrix).  He died soon afterwards. He paid a tax of 800 f. in 1631 and left an estate of f. 334,000. His son Abraham de Marez III appeared on 26 October 1635 and brought 80,000 f. for the children of Abraham de Marez II from his two marriages (WK 5073/789). On 6 June 1637, the honorable Catharina de Marees (II), as mother and unique heiress of Catharina de Marees (I) and, ab intestato, of Maria de Marees (I), both being her children procreated by Isaack de Marees Abrahamsz., her former husband, assisted by Thomas van Roeye, her present husband, on one side, the honorable Johannes de Marees Abrahamsz., for himself; Pieter de Bary, as husband and guardian of Sara de Marees, his wife, together with Mathijs Hals (of INVNO 411),  as husband and guardian of Marija de Marees (II), Sara de Barij, children of majority age of the afore-said Sara de Marees; Daniel Mits I, the father of Samuel Mits of INVNO 1213, as husband and guardian of Marija de Marees (II), with his wife; Pieter Benoijt, as husband and guardian of Anna de Marees, with his wife; Tieleman van Beringen, as husband and guardian of Elisabeth de Marees, with his wife; Anthoni Verspreet as having married Catharina de Marees (II), who was the widow of Jan Wijs, with his wife; Jan de Barij and the afore-said Johannes de Marees and Tielman van Beringen, together testamentary guardians of the children of minor age of the afore-said Sara de Marees, as also the same Jan de Marees and heer Jacob Pietersen Hoochkamer, member of the Vroedschap and former alderman, as respective guardians over the children of minor age of the late Abraham de Marees de jonge, all in their quality as children and grandchildren of Abraham de Marees de oude and of Maria Gemaert, on the other ... all declared that, in order to avoid a suit, they had come to an amicable agreement regarding the sale of the house on the Warmoestraet (NA 521, Not. Westfrisius). Abraham de Marez I's children included Abraham de Marez II, cited above; Johannes Abrahamsz. de Marees; Anna de Marees, married to Pieter Benoijt; Isaack Abrahamsz. de Marees, married to Catharina de Marees, who remarried with Thomas de Roeye after Isaack's death; Elisabeth de Marees, married to Thielman van Beringen (apparently after the death of Maria van Vickervoort);   and Sara de Marees (II), married to Pieter de Bary (NA 522, film 4861, 6 June 1637). On 14 January 1641, the heirs of Abraham de Marees de oude and of Maria Gemaert offered for sale the house de gecroonde Swaen on 113 Warmoesstraet. The conditions of the sale specified that the present renter of the house could take various additions that he had made to the house and a painting of the Schans of St. Andries. The buyer for 29,200 f. was Jan de Bary (the son of Pieter de Bary and Sara de Marees). The sureties were Abraham Fauconnier (cited in the NOTES to R 23490 of Montias2) and Johannes de la Ville. The heirs were Jan de Mareez Abrahamsz., for himself and as guardian over the (minor) children of the late Abraham de Marees de jonge (II?); Abraham (III?) and Pieter de Marees, already of major age; Daniel Mits de jonge (II),  with a procuration from his father Daniel Mits (I), who was married to Maria de Marees (II); Thielman van Beringen, as the husband of Elisabeth de Marees (see the TEXT of R 38)  and as guardian of Mary de Bary; Mathijs Hals, married to Marie de Bary; Adriaen ter Haer (of R 18942), married to Sara de Bary; and [...] ter Haer, in the name of Susanna de Bary, these five persons being children of Sara de Marees; besides Anthony Verspreet (of R 25596), married to Catharina de Marees, all eight (Jan, Abraham de jonge (III), Pieter, Maria, Elisabeth, Sara and Catharina) children of Abraham de Marees de oude, entitled to an eighth part [of the house] sold 7/8 of the house to Jan de Bary, who was himself entitled to 1/8 as the son of Pieter de Bary, the son-in-law of Abraham de Marees II (J.G. Kam, Waar was dat huis in de Warmoesstraat?, 36/2). Abraham Fauconnier, cited above, was an apothecary. He guaranteed a loan for his brother Isaack living in Gorcum on behalf of Laurens van Otteren on 11 February 1638 (NA 422. fol. 84).","Inventaris van de contanten, coopmanschappen, ende meubelen ende imboel, bevonden op te sterffdach ende ten huijse van Abraham de Marees den Ouden, beschreven door mij notaris ... ter requisitie ende overstaen van de samentl[ycke]  kinderen erffgenamen van den selven overleden, sijnde de selve bevonden als volcht.

Spranger was born in Antwerp in 1577 and died in Amsterdam in 1637. As early as 1597, he was the agent of the Heester and Van Uffelen families of traders in the Kola peninsula of Russia (Wijnroks, Handel tussen Rusland en de Nederlanden 1560-1640, p. 260). In Amsterdam, he was a merchant, first in the Bantamstraet, then on the O.Z. Voorburchwal in den Lupart. He married Maria de Pickere in 1613, Catharina de Raet in 1622, and finally Susanna Mostart on 9 April 1630 (she was the daughter of Daniel Mostart I and Bertijnken Bachers) (Elias, Vroedschap, p. 761). He was the brother of Adriaen Spranger, merchant in Cadiz, and Jochem Spranger, merchant in Sevilla (Wijnroks, op.cit. p. 261). In addition, he was the brother of Mattheus Spranger II (cited below).  On 3 March 1613, Gommer Spranger and Maria Thibouts de Pickere signed a pre-nuptial contract. His uncle, the  cloth finisher Lucas van Salinger assisted him (Wijnroks, op.cit. pp. 260-1).  On 10 February 1617, Gommer Spranger presented his two children, Matheus, 18 months old, and Constantia, two months old, whose late mother was Maria de Pickere and declared that the two children had 14,000 f. from their mother's inheritance in addition to the clothes and jewels of the deceased which amounted to 4,500 f. In her testament Maria de Pickere had cited the children's uncle Pieter Coeymans and an uncle by marriage Leonard Rans (married to Constantia Coeymans (Wijnroks, op. cit., p.263). He remarried with Catharina de Raet in 1622 and with Susanna Mostaert, the daughter of Daniel Mostart I, on 22 April 1630.  In 1631, Gommer Spranger, with his wife and children, was taxed 350 f (Kohier, fol. 132, p. 31). (For more biographical details about Gommer Spranger and his close relatives, see the NOTES to R 31375 of Montias2; Daniel Mostart I was the father of Daniel Mostart II, city secretary, of R 21940). The death inventory of Gommer Spranger was taken on 1-5 January 1637 (NA 1412, deel 32(37), Not. F. Bruyningh). In 1644, Matheus Spranger, the brother of Gommer, declared that he and his sister had duly received their part of the inheritance. As guardians over the children were named Jeronimus Rans of INVNO 1334 and Matheus Halewijn of INVNO 257.    At the sales of March and April 1638, the prints and drawings alone brought 1638 f. The records of the sale of Gommer Spranger's paintings have not been preserved, if the sale was ever held. It is possible, however, that the sum cited on the back page of Register 5073/962 of the Orphan Chamber, namely 5707 f. 7 st. included the paintings. Note also that paintings by Bartholomeus Spranger in the death inventory of Maerten van Halewijn, who was an important buyer at the sale of drawings and prints, had been bought at the Spranger auction of paintings. Note that if each print in  lots containing multiple prints (e.g. 120 or more) was inputted as a single record, the ICNT would rise from 1119 to about 1700.","Den 9e februarij 1638 zijn de naervolgende printen, teeckeningen, schilderijen achtergelaten bij Gommer Spranger vercocht."

Hans van Immen seems to have recovered from his illness. It was at the request of the eersame Hans van Immen, silk spinner (zydereeder) that the inventory of Mettje Wonders, widow of Pieter van der Loo, diamond cutter and jeweler of INVNO 920, was drawn up on 11 November 1641. Hans's son Gerrit van Immen, zydereeder, died before 14 March 1638, when Jacob Pancras (the second husband of Neeletje van Immen) appeared before the Orphan Chamber and declared that Jan, 19, the son left by Gerrit van Immen, whose late mother was Elisabeth Haeck, was entitled to 1,348 f. from the inheritance of his grandfather Hans van Immen (WK 5073/789).

Westfrisius,Merchant (largescale),death inventory,Reformed/Calvinist,aen de Deventer houtmarckt in Amsterdam,"According to Johan Elias (Vroedschap van Amsterdam, vol.2, p. 628), the merchant Pieter Boddens, son of Jan Cornelisz. Boddens, fled Flanders for religious reasons. He settled first in Haarlem and then in Amsterdam. He married Mayke van de Put Gerrits in 1594 (Elias, ibid.)  On 6 March 1605, Pieter Boddens and Mayke van der Put had their daughter Susanna baptized in the N.K. in the presence of Aernout Allewijn (DTB 39/60). On 7 September 1619, Pieter Boddinx, from Tielt, widower, living in the Warmoesstraet, was betrothed to Cataline Vervoort, from Antwerp, living in Goes (DTB 763/73).   On 12 September 1619, Pieter Boddens, from Tielt in Flanders, appeared before the Orphan Chamber to present his daughter Mayken, 12 years old, whose late mother was Mayken van der Putte. The child's assets included at least 4000 f. (WK 5073/789). On 30 July 1623, Pieter Boddens and Catrijn Vervoort had their son Pieter baptized in the O.K. in  the presence of Antonij Nijs (of R 7616) and Petronella Syts (DTB 6/54). (Pieter Boddens I and Petronella Syts (or Sijdt) were witnesses to the baptism of a child of Anthony Nijs in 1624).  This first child named Pieter died soon afterwards. On 3 September 1624, Pieter Boddens and Catrijna Vervoocht (sic) had their son, again named Pieter, baptized in the N.K. in the presence of Petronella Syts (DTB 40/269). This second child by the name of Pieter is identical with Pieter Boddens (de jonge) of INVNO 321 (R 239 of Montias1). On 27 February 1631, Pieter Boddens and Caterijn Vervoort had their daugher Cattrijn baptized in the O.K. in the presence of Isaack Boddens and Catrijn Roekoert (DTB 6/298). According to an act dated 15 January 1630, Isaack Boddens had leased a dying works in which he employed Claes Fredericksz., dyer of bombasijn for one year as meester knecht for 24 schellingen per week (Van Dillen, Bronnen tot de geschiedenis van het bedrijfsleven R.G.P. 78(1933), p.696).  Maycken Boddens (of INVNO 328),  the sister of Isaack Boddens, was first married to the preacher Johan Maryn de jonge.   On 9 December 1636, the honorable Jan Maryn de oude, as grandfather on the father's side of Cathalyntge and Johannes Maryn, children of Johan Maryn de jonge, procreated by Maycken Boddens, on one side, and the same Maycken Boddens, widow of the same Jan Maryn de jonge, in his life, servant of God's word (preacher) in Hattem, assisted by Isaack Boddens, her brother and chosen guardian, came to an agreement concerning the inheritance left by Jan Maryn de jonge (NA 414A, fol. 577).  On 5 November 1638, Maycken Boddens appeared on 5 November 1638  before the Orphan Chamber with her brother and guardian Isaac Boddens and declared that her two children were entitled to 5,000 f. on account of their father's death (WK 5073/789). Maycken Boddens remarried with the chamois leather tanner Jan Mathijsz. van Tongeren of INVNO 328 on 15 July 1645. On 15 January 1620, Isaack Boddens, sydelakencooper (silk cloth merchant) bought one third of a house on the Warmoesstraat, called de koopman, from the wine dealer Reynier van Buren (Kam, Waar was dat huis in de Warmoesstraat?, p. 359). In 1628, Isaack Boddens was one of the signatories of a petition to dismiss the Remonstrant leaders of the militia (Wagenaar, Amsterdam, p. 501). Catrijn Roekoert, who was a witness to the baptism of Cattrina Boddens, may have been the widow (nee Catrijn Roseau) of the painter Louis Rocourt of INVNO 624. On 14 August 1630, Pieter Boddens, koopman, had Pieter Mathijsen, cloth dyer, testify regarding the quality of certain dyed cloths (Van Dillen, op.cit.,  p. 723). Pieter Boddens de oude was buried on 11 December 1634 (Elias, ibid.) On 17 January 1636, Catherina Vervoort, widow and custodian of the estate of Pieter Boddens, on one side, and Susanna Ruts (of R 299),  widow of Jan Boddens (Pieter's brother, who died on 22 February 1634), as mother of her five children, on the other, declared that the children were entitled to 2,000 f. for their inheritance from Pieter Boddens (WK 5073/789.) Susanna Ruts was the daughter of Nicolaes Ruts who was portrayed by Rembrandt. Jan Boddens bought a house on the Warmoesstraat, 't huys van Dornik, formerly called de Swaen, from the brothers  Jan, Mathijs, Melchizedeck, and Janneken Sandra on 24 January 1625. He seems to have lived in the same house or next door to his brother (?)  Isaack Boddens (Kam, Waar was dat huis in de Warmoesstraat?, p. 360, 39/16). On 28 August 1636, Cathaline Vervoort passed her testament. She named as her universal heirs her three children Pieter, Abraham, and Cathaline in equal shares. In case of their death, the inheritance was to devolve on Isaack Boddens (NA 642, film 4953, Not. Sybrant Cornelissen). On 29(?) September 1636, Catelina Vervoort, widow of Pieter Boddens and sister of Francois Vervoort, apothecary in Reciff van Pernambuco, named a correspondent in Middelburg to collect money from the W.I.C. on behalf of Francois Vervoort's children (NA 843, fol. 1313, Not. Hoogeboom). On 27 March 1637, Catharina Vervoort, widow of Pieter Boddens (I) named Wybrant van Steijn, merchant in Nantes, to collect 700 f. from Reynier de Vau in Nantes (NA 521, Not. Westfrisius).  On 7 July 1643, Catharina Vervoort drew up a procuration to collect money on a letter of exchange (NA 997, film 1882, Not. Gerrit Coren). On 16 May 1659, Catharina van der Voort (or Vervoort), widow of Pieter Boddens, appeared before notary J. van der Ven to transfer some goods to her daughter Catharina Boddens Pieters, of major age (meerdejarige) (she was baptized in 1631 and was by then 28 years old). These included 15 paintings (a seascape by Porcellis, another by Berestraat), none of which seemed to match with the paintings in the present inventory. Given the date of the present inventory (1635), it is doubtful whether the painting by Berestraat could have been bought before the death of Pieter Boddens. For this inventory, see NA 1129, film 1299. In the Westfrisius inventory of 6 January 1635,  the name of the owner is spelled Buddens. The spelling in Elias's Vroedschap has been retained. In 1631, Pieter Boddens, living on the Deventer Houtmarckt, paid a tax of 75 f. (Kohier, fol. 276vo, p. 63). The religion of Pieter Boddens de oude  is inferred from the titles of the books he owned, including Uijtlegginge Johannes Calvini op alle de sentbrieven van Paulus and books by the strict Calvinist Jacob Triglandius. The fact that Isaack Boddens signed the anti-Remonstrant petition of 1628 complaining about the appointment of Jan Claesz. Vlooswijck, is also significant (Wagenaar, Amsterdam, vol. 3, p. 501). It is not certain whether the individual named Isaack Boddens who was listed as a horse lover belonging to an elite manege in Amsterdam is identical with the one mentioned above (Jaarboek Amstelodamum 65(1960), p.76).","Inventaris van den imboel ende de huysgen raet van wijlen Pieter Buddens ende Catharina van der Voort in haer leven echte luijden binnen deser stadt, beschreven gelijck de selve by het overlijden van den voorn.

He bought a house 't Huys van Doornick, formerly called de Swaen in the Warmoesstraet in 1625 for 22,500 f.. He married Susanna Ruts, daughter of Nicolaes Ruts and Cornelia Ranson (see R 24918 of Montias2),  on 26 February 1619 (Elias, Vroedschap, p. 628). Susanna Ruts was born in Cologne on 4 September 1598 (Elias, op.cit. p.1004).  In 1631, Joannes Boddens, living in the Warmoesstraat, paid a tax of 125 f. Boddens was buried on 22 February 1634.  On 31 August 1634, the honorable Susanna Ruts, widow of Jan Boddens, assisted by her father and guardian Nicolaes Ruts, on one side, and Andries Barentsz., dyer, living on the Regulierspoort, on the other, came to an agreement on the use of an empty lot in front of Andries Barentsz.'s dyeworks, which had been used by Boddens as a garden and closbaen (a sort of tennis court). The widow agreed to pay Barentsz. 24 f. per year for the use of the lot (NA 991, fol.40, Not. J. Bosch).   On 1 April 1636, shortly after the present inventory was drawn up, Mr. Peter van der Hagen, widower of Anna Seroskerken, raad van Brasilien, living in 's Hertogenbosch, was married to Susanna Ruts, from Ceulen, widow of Jan Boddens (De Navorscher 8(1858), p. 318) Pieter van Hagen, baptized in Keulen on 13 May 1598, died in Leiden on 11 January 1668. He was named to the Vroedschap of Brazil in the same year as he was married to Susanna Ruts.  Susanna Ruts died in Lisse on 3 March 1649. Catharina Boddens, the daughter of Joannes Boddens and Susanna Ruts, married Johannes Rooswinckel of Lisse in 1644 (Van Eeghen, Maandblad Amstelodamum 64(1977), p. 99). The son of Susanna Ruts and Pieter van der Hagen, named Petrus, born in Amsterdam on 26 February 1641, became the predikant of the Reformed Church for the delegation of the Dutch Republic in Paris in 1661-2 (Elias, loc.cit.)","Inventory of Susanna Ruts , widow of Joannes Boddens, about to remarry with Pieter van der Hagen, gewezen raed van Indie"

The fact that her husband's brother Jan Pietersz. Sem was the guardian of Marritge Hermans, the sister of the engraver Jan Hermansz. Muller (cf. the NOTES to R 32237 of Montias2), who was most probably R.C., adds to the presumption that at least part of  the family was R.C. Mary or Maritge Bouwers was the daughter of Arent Bouwer (1520-1585) and of Neel Hillebrants.  On 27 March 1619, the sister of Maritge, named Helena Bouwers (see R 27876 of Montias2), sold to him a house situated on the Warmoesstraat (no. 88) (J.G.

On 4 November 1607, Jan le Bleu and Hester le Bleu had their son Francois baptized in the O.K. in the presence of Francen le Bleu and Annetken [Verspreet ?] (DTB 4/219). If the name of the  witness Annetken (Tanneken ?) Verspreet has been correctly read, she was the sister of Hester Verspreet. When the death inventory of Jean le Bleu's father-in-law Hans Verspreet was taken on 2 April 1627, it was supervised by his son  Samuel Verspreet, his son-in-law Isaack Moors (of R 26927) (the husband of his daughter Sara), Jean le Bleu (the husband of his daughter Hester), and Sara Verspreet, together with Pieter van Montfoort and Barent Jansen (of R 20461 ?), who were executors of Hans Verspreet's testament. The  other children of Hans Verspreet were Anthoni (of R 25596) and Jacques (cited in the INTRO)  (NA 562B, fol. 35). Hester must have died shortly after her father's estate was liquidated in 1626.  On 16 November 1628, Hans le Bleu, widower of Hester Verspreet, was betrothed to Cornelia van Mesen, widow of Lenert de Beer (DTB 433/186). Cornelia van Mesen, widow of Lenert de Beer, had signed the Remonstrant petition in the same year 1628. Jean le Bleu, who was also a buyer at auction (R 27639), was the brother of Jacobus le Bleu, student in medicine in 1628. His mother Lenora Venant was the sister of Francoijs Venant de oude (I), the father of the painter Francoijs Venant(II), who was therefore his cousin. The younger Venant became the guardian of Jacobus le Bleu (and most probably of Jean le Bleu as well) after the death of Le Bleu's father.  Jean le Bleu paid a tax of 20 f. in 1631, at which time he lived on the Warmoesstraet, near the St. Jansstraet (fol. 208, p. 48). He moved to a house also named 't Gulde Paert on the Lauriersgracht soon after this inventory was taken. On 15 February 1632, Jean le Bleu, drogist, insinuated Gerrit Gerritsz. Worcum, cloth dealer (NA 843, fol. 41, Not. Hoogeboom).","Inventaris van de huysraet ende goederen van Jan de Bleu, synde als volcht.

He was apparently born in Anwerp between 1553 and 1556 (Gelderblom, Prosopographic Data Base and Zuid-Nederlandse kooplieden, p. 294). The family was Lutheran. On 13 June 1596, Emanuel van Baserode, merchant in Amsterdam, and Clara van Baserode (his sister ?) drew up a procuration to collect money due to them in Koningsberg (in East Prussia) (Winkelman, Bronnen voor de geschiedenis van het Oostzeehandel, R.G.P. 178(1981), p. 403). In 1608, he signed a petition to the burgomasters of Amsterdam, along with a number of other merchants, requesting the revocation of the prohibition to use cashiers to effect money transfers (Van Dillen, Wisselbanken, R.G.P, 59(1925), p. 16).   On 24 June 1619, Emanuel van Basserode sold a warehouse on the Heeregracht to Jan Macare, wool merchant (the brother of Abraham Macare of INVNO 549).  The house was located behind Basserode's own house, called De Appelboom. The store house and Basserode's house were situated outside the Gasthuysmolenpoort on the N.Z  Achterburchwal (Jaarboek Amstelodamum, 21(1923), p. 143.) He apparently lived in his house de Appelboom until the end of his life. He also owned a house on the Nieuwe Houtmarkct on Vlooienburg from 1625 until his death in 1637. He had bought the house on 21 January 1626 from Jan Jochemsz. Pol, carpenter (later lumber dealer), for 6,000 f. (I. van Eeghen, Waar woonde Rembrandt in zijn eerste jaren? Maandblad Amstelodamum 46(1959), p. 153).  This house and sugar refinery was rented by Rembrandt from May 1637 to May 1639 when he bought his house on the Breestraet  (Van Dillen, Bronnen tot de geschiedenis van het bedrijfsleven, R.G.P. 78(1933) p. 590 and S.A.C. Dudok van Heel, Rembrandt van Rijn (1606-1669): een veranderd schildersportrait in Christopher Brown et al. Rembrandt de Meester en zijn werkplaats, Exh. Cat. Rijksmuseum Amsterdam, 1991, pp. 56-7). ).  On 27 January 1624, Emanuel van Baseroode (signs), from Antwerp, widower of Sara (van) Seroij, living on the Coningsgracht, was betrothed to Janneken Willems, widow of Henricus Meijssenius (one year), assisted by her guardian Cornelius van  Coeschot de oude (DTB 669/224). (Thus Janneken Willems was his second and not his first wife as per the INTRO).  On 29 December 1626, Emanuel van Basserode had his daughter Anna baptized in the Lutheran Church in the presence of Gerardt Verpoorten (of R 27491) and of juffr. Badsans (DTB 139/202). Anna, born 27 February 1626 (but only baptized on 29 December of that year?), married Francois de Coster III (1625-1653),  son of Francois de Coster II and grandson of Francois de Coster I of R 29540, on 17 November 1648. After De Coster's death on 23 October 1652, she remarried with Antonie van Beaumont on 24 May 1661. Antoni van Beaumont was an old deacon of the Reformed Church. He got in trouble with the consistory at the time of his marriage with Anna Basserode because Anna was the widow of the brother of his late wife. But, because of his church connections, the objections were soon dropped (Roodenburg, Onder het censuur, p. 312).  When she died on 19 September 1669, an inventory of her possessions was taken which included een conterfeijtsel van Rembrandt sijnde een out wijfje as well as paintings by Jan Lievens, Hercules Seghers, and Philips de Koninck (De Navorscher, ibid., Oud Holland 16(1898), p. 7, and Dudok van Heel, op. cit. p. 66). On 16 September 1632, Emanuel van Baserode had his other daughter Clara, baptized) in the Lutheran Church in the presence of Willem van Dalen (of R 33610 of Montias2) (DTB 140/168). She  married Johan van Overbeke, on 28 May 1652. Before he left for the East Indies where he lived for a number of years, Van Overbeke translated some psalms and wrote some poetry (De Navorscher, 28(1878), pp. 240-1). On 11 March 1634, an arbitration agreement was reached between Baserode and Jasper Jansz. Ypelaer (cited in the TEXT of R 181) concerning the use of a path and a waterlosing which ran between the house of Substitute Schout Tengnagel (of R 19457 of Montias2)  and the house of Marten Codde (of R 21399 of Montias2), belonging to Baserode. The arbiters were Simon van der Does, former alderman, (of R 28462);  Cornelis van Campen (of R 31987); and Nicolaes Balestel (of R 36475), together with Hendrick Danckertsz. (of R 27728) and Herman Jansz. (who appeared in a deposition with Hendrick Danckertsz. in the NOTES to R 27728), both rooimeesters. It was agreed that Baserode and Jasper Ypelaer would pay Tengnagel 25 f. and 140 f. respectively, but that Ypelaer would henceforth have unrestricted access to the waterlosing. Ypelaer's house was located on the West side of the Koninxgracht (NA 694B, film 4980, Not. J. Warnaerts).  On 9 November 1634, Emanuel van Baserode, merchant, as husband and guardian of Janneke Willems, the heiress of Judith Cornelis, named his cousin Elias Jansz., living in Utrecht, to collect  50 f. from the heirs of Hendrickge Elias (NA 843, fol. 765, Not. Hoogeboom).   In March 1653, Francois de Coster gave Rembrandt power-of-attorney to collect debts due to him. Baseroode was a rich man, possessing thousands of gulden worth of schepenkennissen and other securities. He made a bequest in his testament  to the diakonen van de Luters kerck. In 1631, he was living between the Cingel and the Warmoesgracht when he paid a tax of 650 f. (Kohier, fol. 7vo, p. 3). Emanuel van Baserode died on 18 November 1636 (De Navorscher, ibid.)  On 19 November 1637, Pieter van Montfoort and Willem van Dalen (cited above) appeared before the Orphan Chamber as guardians according to testament of Annetge, 11, Claertge, 2, and Judith, 6 months old, whose late mother was Jannetge Willems, and declared that the children were entitled to various assets, including a house on the Coningsgracht near the Gasthuismolen, named De Appelboom, and a sugar refinery in Vloyenburch, on the north side of the Amstel (WK 5073/789). In an accounting of the estate, made in October 1637,  at the request of his widow Jannetje Willems, the sugar refinery was estimated 4,200 f., the house on Vloyenburch, 2,400 f., and the house Den Appel, 12,000 f. (NA 598, fol. 351-377, Not. Lamberti).",Inventaris van alle den goederen van den gemeenen boedel sulx z.

She was illiterate (DTB 675/121). Jan Haes, the nephew or cousin of Balthasar van der Veen, was a wine dealer, as was Roeloff Vos. Roeloff Vrericx Vos, wine dealer on the Wisselsluijs, was insinuated along with many other wine dealers on 30 November 1630 (NA 910, film 1146, Not. Pieter Eyloff). Grietie Hendricks is unlikely to  have been the daughter of the Notary Hendrick Schaeff (of INVNO 123) who was first married in 1624. On 23 April 1643, the honorable Balthasar van der Veen, painter, and the honorable Grietge Heyndricks made their testament. They are living on the East side of the Coningsgracht (probably the house where Grietge was living at the time of her marriage). In case of her death, her good friend Joost Bourgongie will be executor in addition to her husband. The provisions of the testament indicated that she had more money than he did (       Oud Holland 12(1894), p. 58).

Sara died before 9 February 1636 when her mother Jacqueline de Cocq, widow of Esaias Hiole, declared that she had been fully paid from the inheritance left by her daughter Sara, married to Nicolaes Egbertsz. Sturck (NA 991, fol.56, Not. J. Bosch).  On 3 January 1637, Nicolaes Egbertsz., widower of Sara Hiole, was betrothed to Anna van Steenbergen (DTB 445/390).  On 20 November 1639, Niclaes Egbertsz. and Anna van Steenberch had their son Willem baptized in the O.K. in the  presence of Sara van de Venne and Aletta van de Venne (DTB 7/228). Sara van de Venne was the wife of Isaack Hiole (Aletta and Baertie were presumably her sisters). Baertie van der Venne, was  married to Willem van Steenberch, a former alderman of Utrecht, cited in the INTRO,  who was presumably the brother of Anna van Steenberch. Niclaes Egbertsz. van der Sturck was buried on 25 February 1642. 10 f. 13 st. were paid on his behalf to the church (DTB 1100v/46). The putative brother of Niclaes Egbertsz. van der Sturck, named Bartholomeus Egbertsz. van der Sturck, had a daughter Cornelia Bartholomeusdr. van der Sturck, born in 1626, who married Coenraad Temminck, merchant in Amsterdam (Elias, Vroedschap van Amsterdam, p.788). Among the books suggesting that Niclaes Egbertsz. was Reformed: Wtlegginge over de 12 artikulen des christlijcke geloofs, Synod van Dordrecht, a testament, etc.. Another inventory of the movable goods of Nicolaes Egbertsz. van der Sturck (INVNO 4790)  was taken on 21 July 1638, which overlaps in major part with the present inventory (NA 696A, film 4982, Not. Jan Warnaerts).","Inventaris van de goederen van Niclaes Egbertsz. van der Sturck geinventariseert ten versoecke van de eerbare Baertje van de Venne weduwe van wijlen Willem van Steenberch in sijn leven schepen tot Utrecht ... ende transport hebbende van Niclaes Egbertsz. van Sturck ...

An earlier inventory of the estate of Anthony du Plouijs, dyer, had been taken on 6 November 1634, which included all his dyer's equipment. According to this earlier inventory, du Plouijs owned houses, one on the Kloveniersburgwal, one on the Binnen Amstel and one on Huivettersgracht (Van Dillen, Bronnen tot de geschiedenis van het bedrijfsleven, R.G.P., 144(1974), p. 74).   On 30 November 1627, Antonij Ploijs and Jannetje de Pau had their son Antonij baptized in the N.K. (DTB 40/426). On 14 August 1629, Antonii du Plochnij (sic) and Janneken de Pau had their daughter  Janneken baptized in the N.K. (DTB 41/36). On 7 October 1630, Hans Thijsz. ceded to Anthony Duplowy, blue dyer, various yarn-spinning equipment against a debt he owed him (Van Dillen, op. cit. R.G.P., 78(1933), p. 732).  On 26 September 1631, Anthonij Plouij and Janneken de Pauw had a second Jannetie baptized in the O.K. in the presence of Janneken Mathijs DTB 6/348). On 31 December 1635, the eerbare Juffr.

Among the assets, considerable quantities of indigo and cochinella, cotton and linen fabrics, and 8,000 f. in alderman's obligations (schepenkennissen). Abraham van der Sluijs (of R 20029 of Montias2) signed as a witness (NA 412B, fol. 463, Not. Jacob and Nicolaes Jacobsz.) Pieter du Ploijs, cited in the INTRO, was Anthonij du Plouijs's brother.

Hooghkamer and Ida Hendricks Cort. Jan Pietersz., silk cloth dealer, was a member of the Raad of Amsterdam from 1618 to 1638, in which latter year he went bankrupt. Hendrick Hooghkamer was also a silk cloth dealer in the Warmoesstraet. He was only about 21 years old on 25 August 1622 when he signed an agreement, together with 20 other Lyeffhebbers der Nederduytsche Poesy, to provide subsidies to the poet Jan Jansz. Starter (Oud Holland 3(1885), p. 54). He was equipage master of the Admiralty in Amsterdam in 1637 and 1638 (at the time the present inventory was taken). He married Maria de Vogelaer on 6 August 1624. Baptized on 2 July 1606, she was the daughter of Marcus de Vogelaer and of Margaretha van Valckenburgh (of R 23422 of Montias2). She was buried on 23 January 1638. Hooghkamer remarried in Utrecht in August 1639 with Jannetgen Brouwer, widow of Wouter de Leeuw (Elias, Vroedschap, p. 323). Hendrick Hoochcamer, living in the Warmoesstraet, paid a tax  f 120 f. in 1631 (Kohier, fol. 208vo, p. 48). On the attorney Jan Ingels (or Engels), see the NOTES to  R 7620 of Montias2. Joan (or Johannes) de Vogelaer was the brother of Maria de Vogelaer, the wife of Hooghkamer. He had apparently borrowed 6,000 f. from the attorney Jan Ingels, which loan had been guaranteed by Hooghkamer. Joan de Vogelaer must have defaulted on the loan, which Hooghkamer was now responsible for repaying. He had pledged his movable goods plus his salary as Equipage Master of the Admiralty  to Jan Ingels to this end. He may have become insolvent as a result, which would explain his removal to Utrecht for his second marriage. On Joan de Vogelaer's activities as a trader with Russia, see Wijnroks, Handel tussen Rusland en de Nederlanden, 1560-1640, p. 286. On 17 January 1650, Hendrick Hoochcamer signed an agreement with 25 other creditors of Cornelis van Bruegel (cited in the NOTES of R 35467 of Montias) in reduction of his debts. His name in the list of creditors stood just above that of Laurentje Brouwers, who is likely to be one of his second  wife's relatives (DBK 5072/872).","Compareerde d' heer Henrick Hoochcamer Equipagemeester van de E.

On 11 June 1636, Cornelis Jochums, 24, and Claes Adamsz., 25, declared at the request of Dionys Tiercx, father of Andries Winius, that the aforesaid Andries Dionys Winius had gone to Moscow in the year 1634 with his wife and his whole household in order to live there. He had taken all his possessions with him, only leaving his house, standing on the corner of the Kerckhoff or Oude Appelmarckt, that had come from the late Geert Lambrecht, who had been the grandmother (bestemoeder) of Andries Dionys's wife (Economisch-Historisch Jaarboek 2(1916), p. 276). In Moscow, Winius was a merchant and Commissary of His Majesty the Tsar of Moscovy. In 1632, Andries Winius, Thomas de Swaenn and Peter Marcelis (brother of Gabriel and Celio Marcellis) were granted a concession for setting up an iron works in the rich iron district of Tula, south of Moscow (Van Dillen, Van rijkdom en regenten, p. 319).  On 27 July 1654, a dispute is said to have risen between Winius, as Commissary of the Tsar, and sr. Jacob de Lange, merchant in Amsterdam, concerning the delivery of two cases of weapons containing 50 carabins each. Lange claimed that he had delivered them to Hans Marssou in Moscow, which Marssou denied. There were also discrepancies in other shipments (Van Dillen, Bronnen tot de geschiedenis van het bedrijfsleven R.G.P. 144(1974), pp.624-5). On Winius, see also Wijnroks, Handel tussen Rusland en de Nederlanden 1560-1640, passim.  On 19 November 1636, Jacques Bygoet was bound and apprenticed to Dionysius Tircx on behalf of his son Andries Winnius, merchant, for 2 years, to serve in Moscovy.

II, son of Carel Lenertsz.

Bogaert and Pieter Jacobsz. Elias to The Hague in December 1628 to complain about the Remonstrants and was banned from the city of Amsterdam soon thereafter,  or with the spice merchant of that name (Elias, Vroedschap, p.

Wassenaer was a medical doctor and a wine dealer.  He was also publisher of an historical series, which was continued by Barent Lampe (of 28400) after his death. On 20 November 1599, Claes Jansz. (van Wassenaer), 26 years old, living in the Haarlemmerspoort in the Nieustadt, was betrothed to Griet Jacobsdr., 24, living on the O.Z. Voorburchwal. The bride stemmed from the distinguished Persijn family (J.Z. Kannegieter, Dr. Nicolaes Jansz. van Wassenaer 1571/2-1529, Jaarboek Amstelodamum 56 (1964), p.74). His daughter Machteltgen van Wassenaer was 19 when she married Jacob Bartholomeus van Ter Heyde, alias Jacob van der Heyde (at whose request INVNO 260, a notarial inventory of Wassenaer's possessions was drawn up a few days before this sale) and a buyer at auction (R 24355). Nicolaes van Wassenaer was buried in the O.K. on 28 September 1629 (ibid. p. 97).   Jan Jansz. Wassenaer, who was probably the brother of the late Dr. Claes Jansz. Wassenaer, became one  of the directors (supposten) of the Bank van Lening. He was married to Machteltge Jans. His son, named Johannes, who  became  preacher in Niewendam and later in Buiksloot, married Maria Poppen, born in 1606, the daughter of the wealthy Michael Poppen. The marriage took place on 5 June 1635 (Elias, Vroedschap, p. 287).

As early as 1615, a painting of the Three Kings by Barent van Someren was recorded in the inventory of Hendrick Duysterloo. On 28 June 1616, Barent van Someren, 44, testifies with some other witnesses on behalf of the jeweler Franchoys Strick. The previous Saturday, Carlo Hellemans (cited, inter allia, in the NOTES to R 27456 of Montias2), and some other individuals had come to Van Someren's house. A servant of one of the guests had stolen a knife. On 25 May 1619, Adriaentgen Thomas, widow of Hans van Someren (Barent's brother), Barent van Someren, painter, and Pauwels van Someren (also Barent's brother), painter, living in Bolteren in Flanders, sold a mortgage they jointly held on a parcel of land in Boxsel. On 2 December 1624, Barent van Someren delivered 12 paintings to Cathalyntge Bisschops, the widow of the recently deceased Pieter Heeseman (of INVNO 577) in compensation for a debt of 200 f. The widow was satisfied with the transaction. About January 1626, Barent van Someren, citizen (of Amsterdam), and hospita in the Hoff van Hollant, submitted a request (to the magistrates). He had lived 24 years in Amsterdam and had been innkeeper in the Hoff van Hollant. He would now like to lease Het Schilt van Vranckrijck on the Dam. But the rent is too high.He requests that, in case he leases the inn, for the favor that the sales of houses and courts on the New Side should be held in his inn (Bredius, Ã¼nstler-inventare p.209 of the NachtrÃ¤ge).  On 23 July 1626, Barend van Someren, 54, and Adriaen van Nieulandt, 39, made a deposition at the request of Pieter Cornelisz. Blyenbergh (cited in the NOTES of R 26504 of Montias2), that they had gone twice to the house of Jan Marines, picture dealer, to inspect some 32 paintings, which Marines and his wife wished to sell. Jan Marines may possibly be identical with Hans Marijns de oude cited in R 297.  On 28 July 1632, Barent van Someren Lambertsz., born in Antwerp, and the honorable Dianora (Leonora) Mytens, born in Naples, drew up their testament. They named their children, Anna, Sara, Aert, Hendrick, Maria, Leonora, Constantia, and Susanna as their heirs (Bredius, KÃ¼nstler-inventare pp. 802-806). She was buried in Amsterdam on 11 September 1649, coming from op den Dam in 't Schilt van Vranckryck (Bredius, op.cit., p. 209 of the NachtrÃ¤ge).

Hans Wynants, together with Francois Gysels and Hendrick van Riet (of R 24930), owned a company of packers (warehouse operators), who were entrusted by the W.I.C. with the packagien of the W.I.C. goods (Bredius, KÃ¼nstler-inventare, p. 1916). He was taxed 80 f. in 1631, at which time he lived on the East side of the Breestraet (Kohier, fol. 227, p. 52).  On 5 January 1635, Jan Wynants, packer, presented his four children, Joris, of major age, Abraham, 18, Isaac, 15, and Jacob, 12, whose late mother was Catheline Snyder, to the Orphan Chamber and declared that they were entitled to a half house on the Keysersgracht near the Westerkerck (WK 5073/789).

On 5 July 1635, Suanna Robbrecht Zollewaerts, 50, declared at the request of Egbert Egbertsz. (Bisschop), cloth finisher, that, for many years, she had known Aeltgen Aertwels (?), the earlier widow of Egbert Bisschop, who was the requirant's father and mother, together with Johan Fauler (Fowler),  the second husband of the afore-said Aeltgen. The witness further states that she had often heard it said that Aeltge Artels had a good 1,000 f. in her possession, which her first husband Egbert Bisschop  had brought from England. If I understand the document correctly, she had also benefited from the church's assistance (NA 772, Not. Verhey).  Between 14 and 24 July  1635, Rederick Feulerus appeared before Notary Van Zwieten for himself and for the heirs of Jan and Aeltge Feuleris, his father and mother, on one side, and Egbert Bisschop, on the other, and declared that the disputes that had arisen over the estate of Aeltge Feulers should be settled by arbitration of the advocates Jan de Weij and Willem Cats (NA 863, film 579). It would seem that Rederick Feulerus was a son from the marriage of Aeltge Feulers with her second husband  Jan or Johan Fouler (or Feuler).  Rederick (or Redericus) Feulerus was a buyer at the present sale (R 24820 of Montias2).",Den 20 martij 1635 zijn de naergelaten goederen van Egbert Bisschop Infouler ende Aeltge Feuler vercocht

On 30 September 1608, Pieter (II), son of Pieter le Fevre and Margreete (an error for Catharina?) le Fevre, was baptized in the same church (DTB 39/165). Samuel, the son of Pieter Lefebvre and Catharina le Maire (of R 25248), was baptized on 31 June 1610 in the presence of Marie Garnier  (DTB 39/209). On 23 October 1616, Pieter le Febure and his wife Catrijna Lemaijre had their son Abraham baptized in the O.K. in the presence of Hans Lemaijre and Elisabeth Charette (DTB 5/198). Hans Lemaijre (Lemaire), the gilder-leather maker of R 20171, was almost certainly the brother of Catharina Lemaire. Pieter Lefebvre dealt in civets,  tobacco and perfume and was a gold- and silver-chain maker (goud- en zilverdraadtrekker). He lived in het Wapen Venetie on the Kalverstraat. In 1631, Pieter Lefebre (I?)  paid a tax of 30 f., at  which time he was indeed living on the West side of the Kalverstraet (Kohier, fol. 271v, p. 62). He was an occasional buyer at the Orphan Chamber auctions (e.g. R 27387 of Montias2). He seems to be identical with the individual named Pieter le Febure who sold Anthony Claesz. de Jonghe of R 21180 of Montias2 a copper mill in 1611 (M.J. Bok, letter of 3 February 2000). Abraham le Febure was a buyer at the auction sale of his father's estate in 1637  (R 25244 of Montias2). On 11 January 1618, Pieter le Febvre, from Doornik, widower of Catharina le Mair, living in the Calverstraet, was betrothed to Nicole Wimer, widow of Nicolaes Hespel (DTB 422/130). Nicole Wimer (or Wijmer) was the sister of Pieter Wijmer of R 28340 of Montias2 and of Jenne (Joanna)  Wijmer, who married Guilliamme Six. These last two were the parents of Willem Six of R 25271 of Montias2. Nicolaes Hespel was the father of Samuel Hespel of R 25237.   On 5 April 1623, Pieter le Febure(I), Carel Cotteman, and Pieter Gaillard, all gouttreckers, made a deposition concerning the two standard qualities of gold and silver mesh (Van Dillen, Bronnen tot de geschiedenis van het bedrijfsleven R.G.P. 78(1933), p. 542). On 18 June 1633, Abraham le Febure (I), 56, and Pieter le Febure (I), 48, appeared together in a deposition (NA 649B). They may have been brothers or cousins. Abraham le Febure I was the father of Magdalena le Febure who married Johannes van Heusden II, the son of Johannes van Heusden of R 36233.   On 31 January 1635, an inventory of the gold-drawing  equipment was taken of the insolvent Pieter Lefebvre de jonge, living on the Roosegracht, where de gouttreckerswinckel uythangt (Van Dillen, Bronnen tot de geschiedenis van het bedrijfsleven, R.G.P. 144(1974), p. 81). This inventory probably belonged to Pieter le Febure II, the son of Pieter le Febure I of the present inventory. He was 29 years old when he was buried, coming from the Heijligewegspoort, on 26 October 1636, leaving two children (DTB 1130).  Pieter le Febure I was buried on 4 November 1636. Two days later, Garbrant van Warmenhuysen, Notary in The Hague, in his quality as husband of Susanna le Febure, the daughter of Pieter le Febure (I) and his co-heiress, named Hans le Maire (cited above)  to request, on behalf of the ordinary heirs of Pieter le Febure, an accounting from Josias Marschal, pursuant to a contract signed in 1635, concerning a shipment of goods to the West Indies (NA 521, film 4861, Not. Westfrisius). An inventory (unassessed) of the goods of Pieter le Febure, last widower of Nicoltje Wymers, was taken on 4 to 6 February 1637. This inventory contained at least 16 items in common with the present sale. The remaining items were too vaguely described to permit a secure identification. In any case the family portraits in the inventory were missing from the sale (NA 564A, Not. Westfrisius).   On 16 February 1637, Garbrant van Warmenhuysen declared, on behalf of Jeremias Hachgens (of R 25243 of Montias2), his brother-in-law,  that he had transferred an obligation for 183 f., obtained from the late Pieter le Febure (I), to Hachgens (Hagens) (ibid.) Jeremias Hagens was the  husband of Catharina le Febure (born 1602), the sister of Susanna le Febure. On  1 December 1637, Jan (Hans) le Maire  (of R 20171) and Willem Six (of R 25271) appeared before the Orphan Chamber and declared that Anneken, 18, the daughter left by Pieter le Febure (I), goudraettrecker, was entitled to 1184 f. for the inheritance from her uncle Pieter Wymer (of R 28340)  (WK 5073/789). Pieter le Fevre I  was also the father of Jacques le Fevre of R 27452 of Montias2 (who is not mentioned in the otherwise fairly complete genealogy of Pieter le Febure I and his family  by I. Prins in Economisch-Historisch Jaarboek 20(1936)). A third individual named Pieter le Febure (III) was married to Sara Briels in 1632 and after her death to Margaretha Steets, born in Salisbury, England. He appeared before the Orphan Chamber on 2 July 1633 on behalf of his 8-weeks old son (WK 5073/789). Pieter le Feber IV (who seems to be distinct from the other three) was an apothecary who was married to Magdalena Jouderville. After his death, she remarried with Juliaen Teniers (of INVNO 557).  Abraham le Febure I, who was the cousin of Pieter le Febure I, born in 1581 in Antwerp, also lived in Amsterdam since 1604. He was a barber and surgeon and a dealer in civet living in the Niezel. His daughter Maria Abrahams married Pieter van Beyerlant (1632-c. 1668), the son of Abraham Willemsz. van Beyerlant, civet dealer, of R 33141. On 14 November 1623, Pieter Lefebure (I), Denis Denijsz., Harmen Reyniersz., Pieter Denijs, brewer, and Abraham Lefebre, surgeon, committed themselves to delivering to Diego Gomes da Costa, Matias Rodrigues Cardoso and David Abeniacar, Portuguese merchants, for the duration of several years, all the civet that they could gather (Van Dillen, Bronnen tot de geschiedenis van het bedrijfslven R.P.G. 78(1933), p.511).",Den 7e april 1637 zijn de naergelaten goederen van Pieter Le Febvre vercocht.

In a deposition, dated August 1617, Samuel Cooren, verwer, declared that David Buys had dyed vermillion in his house on the Bloemgracht (Van Dillen, Bronnen tot de geschiedenis van het bedrijfsleven R.G.P. 78(1933), p. 828).

Cornelis Roos may be identical with Cornelis Ariaensz. Roos of R 31021 of Montias2.  On 17 May 1622, Samuel Coren and Susanna Cocquels had their son Samuel baptized in the N.K. in the presence of Anna Anselmes (STB 40/169).

On 21 November 1637, Daniel van Haringhoeck drew up his testament. He left 2,000 f. to the Ned. Ref. Kerck, 2,000 f. to the English church, and 2,000 f. to the French church. As universal heir he named his sister Maria van Haringhoeck, wife of Gerard van Santen (of R 26494 of Montias2), former burgomaster of Campen. The executors, Thomas Cave and Eduart de Man, were instructed to sell all the goods in the estate and convert the proceeds to real estate, which should not be alienated but only the rents drawn upon by the heiress. Thomas Cave was a merchant who imported sarges (a woolen textile) from England (Van Dillen, Bronnen tot de geschiedenis van het bedrijfsleven 144(1974), p.40). Maria had two children, Daniel (II)  and Maria, who married Gerrit Blankevoort. Daniel van Haringhoeck's wife Elisabeth Bennincx was apparently  not mentioned in the testament. She had perhaps died by the time it had been drawn up. But neither was his putative daughter Abigael van Haringhoeck who was married to Jan Braems of R 26494 of Montias2 (Jaarboek Amstelodamum 6(1908), pp. 84-6). On 4 December 1637, Daniel van Haringhoeck (probably I)  was buried in the Oude Kerck, coming from the Kloveniersburchwal (DTB 1045/102). On 8 February 1639, Samuel Monio, can maker in Leyden, 36, made a deposition at the request of Jacob Ras. He testified that he had received from Ras four bales of wool which had been bought from Daniel van Haringhoek (II) (NA 1276, film 1354, fol. 54, Not. Barcman).",Den 20 januarij 1638 zijn de naergelaten goederen van Daniel van Haring Hoeck en Lysbeth Bennincx vercocht.

He may also be identical with the same (?) individual who bought many lots at the sale of the sculptor Cornelis van der Block (INVNO 631) on 12 May 1629, although the latter is more likely to have been a carpenter. The following baptismal records undoubtedly refer to the owner of the goods in this sale. On 2 September 1618, Sijmon Teunisz. and his wife Anne Jans had their son Govert baptized in the N.K. in the presence of Marij Jans (DTB 40/17). On 13 March 1629, the same parents had their daughter Elisabeth baptized in the N.K. in the presence of Ester Jans (DTB 41/13). Symen Thonisz. may have been the brother of Pieter Thonisz. (one of the buyers at the sale), who in turn may have been the painter of that name (see the NOTES to R 8388 of Montias2),  and of Hendrick Theunisz., likewise a buyer (R 8368 of Montias2), who married Lysbeth Jans (the sister of Anne, Marij, and Ester Jans ?).",Den 9e januarij 1635 sijn de naergelaten goederen van Symen Thonisz. ende Anne Jans zal. vercocht.

In January (?) 1628, Pieter Hermansz., wine dealer (cited in the TEXT of R 391), sold a house on the Zeedijck to Jan Maes, wine dealer, for 2,300 f. (WK 5073/913).

The wine dealer should not be confused with Jan Maes, married to Anna van der Meer who died before 1 March 1652 when his widow signed a marriage contract with the tobacco dealer Paulus van Heemskerck (INVNO 1173). It is not clear which of the two, if not a third individual with this name, living on the Rockin, paid a tax of 30 f. in 1631 (Kohier, fol. 251, p. 57).",Den 6en february sijn vercocht de naergelate goederen van Jan Maes ende Trijntge Pieters.

He was an attorney before the court (de Vierschaer) of Amsterdam. He was portrayed as a shooter in the company of Reynst Pietersz. in a group portrait by Dirck Barentsz. in 1585 (Oud Holland 15(1897), p. 136). He was the father of Frans van Marcken of R 23546 of Montias2, sheriff of Amstelveen in 1635; of Maritgen van Marcken, married to Andries Mombers; of Diewertgen van Marcken, married to Pieter Cornelisz.; and of Aeltgen van Marcken, married to Barent Gerritsz. Bernardyns, who died before 11 May 1629, when she appeared before the Orphan Chamber as a widow with children (WK 5073/789). Aeltgen van Marcken apparently remarried with Jan Garbrantsz., ship's carpenter, before 9 January 1636, when she was scheduled to appear before the Commissary for Small Affairs (commissaris voor cleijne saecken) (NA 991, fol. 1, Not. J. Bosch).  On 29 July 1632, Anna Claes, assisted by her guardian Hendrick Claesz. van Marcken, appeared before the Orphan Chamber on behalf of her children with her late husband, a shoemaker (WK 5073/789). Hendrick van Marcken was portrayed, possibly by Cornelis Ketel or by Dirck Barendsz., approximately in 1609, in the Korporaalschap of Reynst Pietersz. and vaandrig Claes Claesz. Kruijs (Blankert, Amsterdams Historisch Museum, p. 404). In 1602, Reijnier Paeuw invested 100 f. for Hendrick van Marckel in the first subscription for V.O.C. shares (Van Dillen, Het oudste aandeelhoudersregister, p. 251). Hendrick van Marcken was a buyer of porceleijn at an Orphan Chamber sale of 16 October 1626 (WK 5073/952). Hendrick van Marcken must have died in late 1634 or early 1635 when his family came to an agreement on the settlement of the estate. which had apparently had more assets than debts and was to be turned over to his creditors. The agreement was  signed on 11 February 1635 by the widow Maritgen Everts de Swart; by Frederick Harmensz. Dickstein, her brother-in-law; by her nephew and guardian Jan Pauw; by her son Frans van Marcken; by Andries Mombers, married to Maritgen van Marcken; by Pieter Cornelisz., married to Dieuwertgen van Marcken; and by Aeltge van Marcken, widow of Barent Gerritsz. (Bernardyn) (NA 991, film 1220, fol.25, Not. Jan Bosch). On 14 March 1636, Maritge de Swart, widow of Hendrick van Marcken, named Hugo van Groenewegen to defend her against Frans van Marcken, Schout of Amstelveen (NA 991, fol.26, Not. J.

He opined, however, that, although there was a large number of prints and drawings in the sale, there were verie fewe pictures, not for my Lordes turne (cited by Jaap van der Veen in Burlington Magazine, March 2004). This is the only contemporary comment on an Amsterdam sale that has come to light. Jan Basse de Oude, from Rijssel (Lille), 43 years old, assisted by Guiljam Basse (I), his father, was betrothed on 19 May 1611 to Cornelia Kief, 24, assisted by her mother Anna van Liesveld. He lived on the O.Z. Voorburgwal, she on the Koningstraet (betrothal in the Church) (Oud Holland, 3(1885), p. 60.) On 25 December 1616, Jean Basse and Cornelia Kif  had their son Henrij baptized in the Walloon Church in the presence of Diricq Kif and Jenne Derondeau, femme de Guillaume Basse le jeune (DTB 130/39).  On Guillaum Basse and Jeanne Derondeau (or Arondeau), see R 31003 of Montias2. On 4 August 1624, Jan Basse and Cornelia Kif had their daughter Cornelia baptized in the same church in the presence of Guillame Basse and Catherine Kif, femme d'Israel Jerbier (DTB 130/39). On Israel Jerbier, a buyer at WK auction, see R 23616.  The seller of the goods, Pieter Jacobsz. Indische Raven (II), is presumed to be the son of Pieter Jacobsz. Indische Raven de oude (I),  who died shortly before January 1626 (R 31326 of Montias2). In 1634, Jan Basse lived on the Uytrechtsche Steyger, next to the cakebaker Marcus Jansz. (NA 771, act dated 12 December 1634).  In the introduction to the inventory taken of the goods of Jan Basse on 6 January 1637 by Notary Pieter Barcman, it was noted that Pieter Indische Raven, guardian of Willem Basse, son of Jan Basse, had requested the inventory, along with Hendrikje Basse, daughter of the late Jan Basse de jonge. The inventory was also made op 't aengeven of Willem Basse and Jannetge Andries, the widow of the foresaid Jan Basse de jonge (Bredius, KÃ¼nstler-inventare, vol. 1, p. 129.) According to the accounting delivered by Pieter Indische Raven to the Orphan Chamber on 22 June 1640, some of the assets left by Jan Basse I were given to Guilliam Basse, the uncle of Henrickge, the daughter left by Jan Basse II, and some to Janneke Andries, the widow of Jan Basse II (WK 5073/789, fol. 244.

The present  sale contained some silver and a few jewels, including a diamond, which was sold to Sara IJsacx (of R 27195 of Montias2) for 11 f. 5 st. Pieter Jansz van Loo lived op de Dam (on the N.Z.) in 1606 when he bought lots in the Haarlem lottery for 7 f. (GAA 119/22 F 882). This address corresponds to the one he gave when he seems to have been underbidder for three lots in 1609 (including R 29436, where he gave his address as  in de 3 Vijseltgens op den Dam, where auction sales were frequently held). . On 6 May 1613, Pieter Jansz. van Loo was said to be impost meester van de bieren (Van Dillen, Bronnen tot de geschiedenis van het bedrijfsleven R.G.P. 78(1933), p.48; in 1630, he was said to be impost meester van de wijnen (ibid. p. 709). In 1631, Pieter Jansz. van Loo, living on the Keizersgracht, paid a tax of 20 f. (Kohier fol. 90, p. 22). Abraham Jansz. van Loo was presumably the brother of Pieter Jansz. On 10 July 1635, Abraham Jansz. van Loo, the uncle, and Reynier Ranson, the uncle by marriage, of Sara van Loo (presumably Pieter Jansz.'s sister) brought assets  to the Orphan Chamber for Hester, 14, and Lysbeth, 10, inherited from their grandaunt Lisbeth Ridders (WK 5073/789).   On 8 October 1635,  Harmen Jacobsz. van Doornick, who had been appointed guardian and administrator over the person of Claes van Loo, the orphan child left by Pieter Jansz. van Loo, who had lived on the Bloemgracht, named Hendrick Teunisz., as husband and guardian of Mary Jans, the sister and co-heir of Pieter Jansz. van Loo, to collect rents due to the estate. Claes and Mary Jans divided the estate in equal halves (NA 772, Not. Verhey). On 18 October 1635, the Orphan Chamber received the sum of 968 f. from the estate of Pieter Jansz. van Loo, lyndrayer (linen worker), whose late mother was Ytge Gerrits [G...t]. Pieter Jansz. was apparently not married (WK 5073/789). Pieter van der Loo of INVNO 1310, a diamond cutter and jeweler,  was another individual. Finally, there was a broker named Pieter de Loo who was said to be 36 years old in an act dated 14 October 1637 (NA 522, film 4861). He may be identical with the spices merchant  Pieter van Loo who was said to be 21 years old when he was betrothed to Aeffgen van der Waart,  on 1 February 1625.

Rutger Jansz. was perhaps identical with Rutger Jansz. van Dorssen at whose request goods were sold in 1601 (R 690).  Pieter de Bitter was the guardian of the child of Maritie's  first marriage with Jurriaen Fredericxsz. An initial inventory, taken without appraisals, was made on 16 February 1630. Only four portraits were described by subject. The remaining six schilderijtgens were untitled (GAA, not. Westsfrisius, no. 563A). On Nicolas Cocques (or Cocqus), see R 20336 of Montias2. The house of Femmetge Teunis, which was said to be close by the old Glashuis, seems to be the one on the Kloveniersburgwal, next to no. 38, with which it had a common trap en opgang (I. van Eeghen, De restauratie van Kloveniersburgwal 38, Maandblad Amstelodamum, 62(1975), p. 22.) The Oude Glashuis was the glass making plant of Jan Jansz. Karel (later owned by his son-in-law Floris Soop)  on the Kloveniersburgwal. The woman named Femmetje who bought lots in the Haarlem lottery and was said to be living in the house of Jan Jansz. Carel de jonge, was probably identical with Femmetge Theunis of the present inventory  (see Maandblad Amstelodamum 62(1975), p. 134). On Pieter Cocquu (or Cocques), see the NOTES to R 20336 of Montias2; on Pieter de Bitter, the NOTES to R 23618 of Montias2. It is most doubtful whether the following deposition refers to the same Femmetje Theunis. On 4 September 1635, Joris van Nieulandt, 35, coffin maker (not identical with the father of the painter Adriaen van Nieulandt of the same name), 35, living in the St. Jansstraet, and Albert Dircksz., ebony worker, 35, living in the Stoofsteech, declared at the request Femmetje Theunis, who was once married to Bouwen Lourensz., cloth finisher (droochschilder) that they had known Lourens Bouwens who had gone as a sailor (bootsman) on the ship Prince Willem to the East Indies and they are also aware that Lourens was the son of the petitioner. He was the brother of Emertje Bouwens (NA 597, Not. Lamberti). According to Bredius, Femmetje Teunis of the present inventory  was the mother of the well-known merchant David Rutgers. Femmetge did have a son named Rutger Rutsz. who bought a work of art at the sale of her goods (R 37186 of Montias2)There but he was almost certainly not identical with the silk cloth dealer David Rutgers III, the son of David Rutgers II and of Josua Lamberts, the merchant with whom Bredius apparently confused him.  On David Rutgers II and III, see the NOTES to R 37186.",Den 25e february 1630 zyn ten versoecke van Niclaes Cocquus ende Pieter de Bitter als voogden van de nagelatene kinderen van Femmetge Teunis vercocht dese naervolgende goederen.

He was the brother of Augustijn (born about 1586), Hans (born in 1592), and Franciscus (Francoijs) (born 1593), who all predeceased him (Gelderblom, loc. cit.) He was betrothed to Elisabeth de Bacher, daughter of Andreas de Bacher, on 23 June 1621. On 22 February 1627, after the death of his first wife, Anthonie Thysz., assisted by his uncle Anthonie Thyskens, professor of theology at the University of Leyden, 32 years old, was betrothed to Magdalena Beltens, from Amsterdam, 27, assisted by her father Pieter Belten (de oude) (DTB 432/66). On 9 June 1630, the couple had their daughter Levina baptized in the O.K. in the presence of Constantinus Lempruer (l'Empereur) and Juffr. Constantia Coymans (wife of Pieter Belten de jonge, the brother of Magdalena Pieter Beltens) (DTB 6/275). Constantin l'Empereur was the husband of Catherina Thijs, the sister of Anthonie. On 25 May 1631, Anthonie and Magdalena had their son Pieter baptized in the presence of Pieter Wachtendorp (Wachtendonck?)  and Janneken de Raet (DTB 6/306). On 9 May 1632, they had a son named Anthony baptized in the presence of Jacques Beltesz. and Abigael Thijssen (DTB 6/336). After the death of this first Anthonie, they again had a son of that name baptized in the N.K. on 29 May 1633, in the presence of Joanna Bevers (DTB 41/254). Anthony died before 8 September 1634, when he was said to be zaliger (Tysz. archive, 112 F 6). Magdalena remarried with Anthonie's cousin Christoffel Thysz.  (the son of Franchoijs Thysz., the brother of Hans Thysz. de oude) in the same year 1634. Christoffel Thysz. and his wife Magdalena Beltens sold their house on the Breestraet to Rembrandt on 5 January 1639 (Strauss, Rembrandt Documents, p. 158). For another inventory, partially overlapping with  the present inventory, but taken after Magdalena's remarriage with Christoffel Thijsz., see INVNO 1089. In a note on the assets and liabilities of the estate of the late Anthonie Thys, dated 8 September 1634, it was said that de resterende ongedeelde schilderijen ende boecken, which could be kept or  sold (te vercopen staen), were appraised at 1070 f. (Thys Archive, University of Leiden, 112 F 6).  Since many of the paintings in the present inventory were inherited by Magdalena Belten (INVNO 1089), they could not be undistributed, at least subsequently.",Volgen de schilderijen so Thysz.

Warnaerts,Merchant (largescale),death inventory,Reformed,On the East side of the Keysersgracht in Amsterdam,"Samuel Godijn (Godin)  (1561-1633)  was a wealthy merchant, originally from Southern Netherlands, who was related by marriage with several prominent families in Dordrecht, Middelburg, and Amsterdam. His parents are tentatively identified as Jean Godin and Barba Vivien (see below). He first settled in Bremen and was first noted in Amsterdam in 1604 (Gelderblom, Zuid-Nederlandse kooplieden, p. 302). Together with his brother  Daniel Godijn, cited in the above INTRO and noted below, he invested 3,000 f. in the first subscription for V.O.C. shares in 1602 (Van Dillen, Het oudste aandeelhoudersregister). On 30 October 1613, he had various goods sold by the Orphan Chamber, including a number of moderately priced paintings without titles (INVNO 902). He freighted a ship to Oporto in Portugal  on 4 May 1616 (with Jan Stassaert and Gillis Dodeur of R 29979 of Montias2). In the late 1620s, when a controversy arose within the W.I.C. as to whether the emphasis of the company's activities should be placed on the expansion of trade or the acquisition of further colonies, Samuel Godijn was one of four merchants -- the others were Samuel Bloemmaert of R 21578, Allert Coenradsz. Burgh, and Kilian van Rensselaer -- who opted for further colonisation (Jaarboek C.B.G. 50(1996), p. 113). In 1632 he was said to be participating in a colony, presumably in Brasil, with Mathijs van Ceulen (of INVNO 165).  On 24 August 1602, Samuel Godijn  married Anneken Anselmo in Bremen, born in Antwerp on 8 July 1583. She was the daughter of Anthonis Anselmo and of Janneken Hooftman (Jaarboek C.B.G. 36(1982), p. 114). A portrait of Antonio Anselmo and of his wife Johanna Hooftman with two of their children, presently in the Brussels Museum voor Schoone Kunsten, where it is attributed to Marten de Vos, is recorded in the present inventory (R 41304 of Montias2).   On 14 October 1616, Samuel Godin and his wife  Anne Anselmo had their daughter Maria baptized in the Wa. K. in the presence of Jean Fauconnier (of INVNO 243) and Marie Godin (DTB 130/36). Maria Godin is probably identical with the woman of that name, married to Thomas le Carlier, whose daughter Rachel le Carlier was the first wife of Jacques Schott, cited above (Elias, Vroedschap, p. 579).  On 2 January 1619, they had their son Loijs baptized in the same church in the presence of Symon (Jacobsz.)  van der Does and Marie Angele Anselmo (DTB 130/79). Symon Jacobsz. van der Does, secretary of the Assurantie Kamer, was married to Beatrix Anselmo, the sister of Anne Anselmo. Samuel Godijn's daughter Cecilia married Hendrick Trip (of R 24909 of Montias2) of Dordrecht, 28 years old, on 31 March 1633 (DTB 440/216). Cecilia died in 1633.  Another daughter, named Johanna, married Jacob Trip, the brother of Hendrick Trip, on 14 February 1634 (Elias, Vroedschap, pp. 548-9). Daniel Godijn, born about 1576, the son of Jean Godin and Barba Vivien,  was married to Sara Dragon (DTB 130/160 and Jaarboek C.B.G. 19(1965), p. 182). In view of the presence in the present inventory of a portrait of the late Jan Godijn (R 41292 of Montias2), it appears very likely that Daniel was Samuel's brother and that the late Samuel Godijn (or Godin) was also the son of Jean Godin and Barba Vivien. Hendrick Trip, cited in the INTRO, born in Dordrecht (1607-1666), was a wealthy trader in armaments and a buyer at Orphan Chamber auction  (see the NOTES to R 24909 of Montias2). On 20 September 1633, Samuel Godijn and Juffr. Anna Ancelmo Anthonis signed a codicil to their testament dated 13 August 1608. Each son stood to inherit 2,000 f. before the division of the estate. His heirs were his son-in-law Hendrick Trip and his wife Cecilia Godin, and his sons  Samuel Godijn de jonge (who would inherit 20 morgen in Beemster) and Philips Godijn, whose inheritance would depend on his comportment. He made bequests to the French (Reformed) community of 50 pounds Fl. and 100 f. to Do. Bassecour, the dienaer of that community (NA 694B, film 4980, Not. J.

He was married to Anna van Valckenburg, daughter of Jan van Valckenburg of R 31706 of Montias2. It was apparently Arnout Cobbaut II who bought lots in the Haarlem lottery of 1606, at which time he was already living in the Vergulde Hart in the Warmoesstraet (he must have kept the name of the house when he moved to the Nieuwe Hoochstraet soon thereafter). On 22 April 1610, his son Arnout Cobbaut III was betrothed to Anna Cruijpenninck, at which time he  was called Arnout Cobbaut de jonge (DTB 414/285). This is confusing because when Arnout Cobbaut, clearly the second of this name since he was said to be living in the Nieuwe Hoochstraet, bought a lot at the Rauwart sale of 1612 (at which time his son of the same name was still alive), he was also called de jonge. Arnout Cobbaut III died in 1616 (INVNO 542). Arnout Cobbaut II invested 20,350 f. in the second subscription for V.O.C. shares in 1612  (Van Dillen, Het oudste aandeelhoudersregister, p. 259). Also in 1612, Arnout Cobbaut de jonge (probably II),   merchant in Amsterdam, sold several lots in the drying up and damning of the Beemster (NA 128, Extracten). On 22 January 1613, Arnout Cobbaut de jonge (probably II, but possibly III) declared at the request of Jan Benninck Koeckebacker that he had sold to Lenart Ranst a share for 300 Fl. Pounds in the V.O.C (Van Dillen, Economisch-historisch Jaarboek 16(1930), p. 131). Portraits of Arnout Cobbaut II and his wife Anna van Valckenburgh are preserved in the Utrecht Centraal Museum. The other children of Arnout Cobbaut II were: Sara, married to Balthasar Visscher (of R 20375 of Montias2); Judith, married to the sugar confectioner  Hans (or Jean)  de l'Hommel; Susanna Cobbaut, married to Pieter Stas; Anna Cobbaut, married first to Michiel van Verbeecke and, after his death, to Gillis Smissaert (of R 30704 of Montias2); Elisabeth Cobbaut, married to Pieter de Schilder (of R 27188 of Montias2); Barbara Cobbaut, married first to Balthasar van der Veecke and, after his death, with Toussain Blanche (of INVNO 1191); and Gillis Cobbaut, innocent (retarded). Arnout Cobbaut II passed his testament on 12 January 1634, leaving most of his estate to the children of the late Judith Cobbaut (NA 409, film 4787).","Inventaris van de ... huysraet, schilderijen bevonden int sterfhuys van Sr. Arnout Cobbaut ende Juffr.

On 23 January 1635, she was betrothed to Johannes (or Jan) Looten, born on 1 October 1612 (died 10 May 1676). He was the son of Charles Looten, born in Brugge in 1575, who died in Amsterdam on 1 October 1652. Charles Looten was associated in business with Jacob Quina of R 30652 of Montias2. Johannes Looten lived on the Heeregracht, near the Bergstraet in den Moor. He was taxed on a fortune of 400,000 f. in 1674. He became Dijkgraaf of the Beemster in 1664 and Lieutenant of the civil militia in 1661. On 25 October 1625, Johannes Looten and Elijsabet Hellings had their daughter Geertruijt baptized in the O.K. in the presence of Charles Looten (Johannes's father), Marija de Hem, and  Clara Nijs (the mother of Gertruyd Hudde) (DTB 7/62). On 27 April 1635, Joannes Looten, as the husband of Elisabeth Hellings, stated in a deposition that Hendrick and Gerrit Hudde and Isaack Moors (of R 26927 of Montias2)  were the guardians of his wife (NA 598, fol.1).  After the death of Elisabeth Hellincx, who was buried on 10 November 1635, Looten  remarried with Appolonia Selijns, daughter of Willem Jansz.  Selijns on 28 October 1642 (Elias, Vroedschap, p.708).

The late  owner of the goods in this inventory would seem to be Claes Claesz. Ansloo de oude (I),  who was married to Giert Jans. The following extract from the codicil to the will of Giert Jans, widow of Claes Claesz. Ansloo de oude, helps to unravel some of these relations. According to a document cited below, Giert Jans was born about 1561.  In her codicil, dated approximately 18 April 1633, Giert Jans ordained that her son Claes Claesz. Ansloo de jonge (II) should inherit the house on the Nieuwen Dijck on the North corner of the Oude Bruggesteech, called de Goude Candelaer and that her other son Cornelis Claesz. Ansloo, should inherit the house next to it, called de Kalckoen Haen. Jacob van Davelaer signed as witness (NA 595, fol. 547, Not. Lamberti). On 25 October 1633, Jan Barentsz., bed seller in the Colcxsteech, named his wife Femmetgen Maertens to appear before the aldermen and there to acknowledge a debt of 2,000 f. at 5 percent interest from Geert Jans, widow of Claes Claesz. Ansloo (NA 694B, film 4980, Not. J. Warnaerts). Cornelis Claesz. Anslo(o) I, the famous teacher of the Mennonite community portrayed in etching by Rembrandt in 1640 and 1642, was the brother of Claes Claesz. Ansloo de oude (I).   On 28 September 1635, Geert Jans, widow of Claes Claesz. Ansloo de oude, 74, declared at the request of Hestertgen Willems (van Nieuwkerck),  formerly married to Reyer Claesz. Ansloo (her son), that Joris Samuelsz. had worked many years in the cloth shop (of Claes Claesz. Ansloo) (NA 695A, film 4981). Reyer Claesz. Anslo was a poet. He was a friend of the painter Abraham van den Tempel and a member of the Waterland Community of Mennonites. On 22 May 1647, he obtained a venia aetatis (majority age, even though he has less than 25) so that he could start a textile business with his older  brother Nicolaes (Wijnman, it den kring van Rembrandt and Vondel, p.58). On 14 August 1636, Rycken Reyers, 12, daughter of Reyer van Ansloo, merchant on the Heeregracht, passed her testament. She named her mother Hester Willems as her universal heir (NA 315, fol. 77). It was almost certainly the same Claes Claesz. Ansloo I, living along the Cingel (the old Heeregracht), who paid a tax of 100 f. in 1631 (Kohier, fol. 113vo, p. 27). On 5 October 1630, Joris Cornelisz., lumber dealer in Emden, declared at the request of the honorable Claes Claesz. Ansloo (probably I) and Cornelis Claesz. Ansloo (I)  that he had gone to Vrieslandt in 1625 to collect money for the two petitioners from Bruyn Jansz., cloth dealer (NA 847). On 19 February 1637, Jan Claesz. Ansloo, 32, declared at the request of Gierte Jans (his mother), widow of Claes Claesz. Ansloo, that he, Jan Claesz., had lived in the house 't gulde Schilt on the Nieuwen Dijck  during his father's life (NA 598, fol. 108). Cornelis Claesz. Anslo(o) II was baptized as an adult in the Remonstrant Church on 6 May 1638. He married Aeltje Gerrits Schouten. The poet and textile merchant  Reyer Claesz. Ansloo (Rijke Ansloo), died before 28 September 1631 when his widow Hester Willems van Nieuwkerck remarried with Jan Rodenburgh, widower of Annetge Cornelis van Hemert. If  Jan Claesz. Ansloo who declared that some of the goods in the present  inventory belonged to him was also a son of Claes Claesz. Ansloo I, it is curious that he was not cited in Giert Jans's testament. Jan Claesz. Ansloo, born about 1605, married Fockeltge Pieters van Hoorn of R 25490 of Montias2 on 17 January 1627, and was buried on 5 January 1647. He was a cloth merchant on the Nieuwen Dijck in 't vergulde Schilt (probably the same house formerly known as de Kalckoen Haen)  (Elias, Vroedschap, p. 449). Joost Claesz. Ansloo, born about 1590 may have been another son of Claes Claesz. Ansloo I and Giert Jans. He was a  cloth seller on the Nieuwen Dijck (waerdijn of the cloth trade in 1634); he married Lijsbet Gerrits Hooft on 4 July 1616. After her death he remarried with Niesje Lamberts Schouten, the daughter of Lambert Cornelisz. Schouten (cited in the NOTES of R 347 of  Montias1) and of Christine Matthijs Meijninga, on 10 February 1618 (Jaarboek C.B.G. 35(1981), p. 100).

Clapmus (or Clapmuts),was born in 1584, the son of the sailmaker Dirck IJsbrantsen Clapmuts and of Aechje Adriaens. He was buried on 6 November 1629.  His wife Lijsbet Jans van Groenewegen, with whom he was betrothed on 27 January 1613, was born in 1587. She was the daughter of Jan Huych Wollebrantsznzn., lumber merchant, and of Lijsbet Claes (whose portrait appears in the inventory). Lijsbet Claes died in Amsterdam between August 1607 and June 1608. Lijsbet Jans  was buried in Amsterdam on 27 September 1634. The bells were rung for her funeral (Roman Catholic). She was the sister of Mary Jans Groenewegen, cited in the INTRO, and, presumably, of Anne Jans Groenewegen, at whose request the goods in INVNO 1017 were sold. Finally, there was a woman named Aefje Jans Groenewegen who was married to the broker Salomon Pietersz. Reus (DTB 671/78). All three may have been daughters of Jan Groenwegen, merchant in Amsterdam, who sold armaments and gun powder to load on a ship sailing to Guinea in 1594 (Economisch-Historisch Jaarboek 2(1916), p.245). Cornelis Dircksz.  Clapmuts and Lijsbet Jans lived on the Nieuwen Dijck, on the Western corner of the Clapmutssteechje in het rood Schaeckbort, which corresponds to the above address. In 1631, Cornelis Dircxz., living on the West side of the Nieuwen Dijck, paid a tax of 15 f. (Kohier, fol. 58vo, p. 19). He must have died before 24 March 1633, when his widow, Lysbeth Jans, and  Dirck Wolphertsz. Persijn, married to Diewer Dircx (the presumed sister of Cornelis Dircx) made a declaration concerning the inheritance (NA 595, fol. 13, Not. Lamberti).  The present  inventory was drawn up after the death of Lijsbeth Jans. Note that various altaer goet were included in the inventory, which suggests, as Dudok van Heel pointed out, that meetings of Catholics took place in the house.  The house het Roode Schaeckbort was sold on 24 January 1641 for 12,400 f. The sellers stipulated that they could take with them a painting of Rebecca (not cited in the inventory) which stood in the binnecamer downstairs (S.A.C.

He is likely to have been a buyer at auction in 1619 (R 20405 of Montias2). The later (1621 to 1626) purchases by Paulus Buys are believed to have been effected by his son the painter  Paulus Buys de jonge (1590 to c. 1656), cited in the INTRO (see also the NOTES to R 23234 of Montias2). Abraham Buys, also cited in the INTRO, was the son of Paulus Buys I. He was married to Sara Flines, who seems to have been the daughter of Gysbert de Flines (both also cited). The latter is identical with Gilbert de Flines II (1588-1654) of Montias2 (the father of Gilbert de Flines III of INVNO 446)  On 10 January 1639, Guiljam Basse, silk dyer, 69 (of R 31003 of Montias2) declared at the request of Hans Biermans that, in 1606, he had bought a house near the Rouen Poort from Paulus Buys, merchant, who in turn had bought it from Jan Londerseel (the engraver) (NA 921, Not. B. J. Verbeeck). Hans Biermans, married to Susanna Conincx, was the brother-in-law of the painter Salomon Coninck (see R 20534 of Montia2).   In 1614 Paulus Buys I constituted himself surety for the painter David Vinckboons when the latter bought a house in Amsterdam.  Originally a silk weaver, he had become a broker by 1625 (Briels, Vlaamse schilders, p. 308). Jacob Abrahamsz. Greven was the son of  Abraham Jacobsz. Greven, who became insolvent in 1660 (DBK 5072/367 and INVNO 884).","Inventaris van den goederen die Pauwels Buys metter doot ontruymt ende nagelaten heeft, geinventariseert ten versoecke van Jacob Abrahamsz.

Stephanus Bacherus studied medicine at Leiden University in 1592 and received his medical degree from Basel in 1595.  On 16 January 1601, Stephanus Bacherus, from Antwerp, 30, assisted by his sister Mayken de Bacher (II), was betrothed to Meyken Martens, 20, living op 't Water, assisted by her father Hans Martensz. (of R 28860 of Montias2). Hans Martens was married to Stephanus's sister Mayken de Bacher II (Mayken de Bacher I was the sister of Andreas de Bacher). Hans Martens lived in den Otter on the Water (today's Damrak), which may have been the house where at least part of Stephanus Bacher's movable goods were found after his death. Daniel Martens (of R 6432), the guardian of Stephanus Bacher's children of minor and major age, at whose request the present inventory was drawn up, was the son of Hans Martens. Anthony van der Heeden I (of INVNO 256) was first married to Hester Martens, who was also the daughter of Hans Martens. Stephanus Bacherus was a witness at the baptism of Catarijna, the daughter of Anthony van der Heede and Hester Martens on 11 August 1613 (DTB 5/155). On 6 June 1617, Stephanus Bacherus (of R 25443) assisted Abigael Martens when she was betrothed to Marten Halewijn (DTB 432/231). Abigael Martens was another daughter of Hans Martens. Hans Martens invested 600 f. in the first subscription for V.O.C. shares on behalf of Stephanus Bacher. Daniel Bacherus, cited in the INTRO, was baptized in the N.K. in Amsterdam on 20 September 1615. He became a drogist and merchant. On 29 March 1617, he married Catharina Hooft. After Daniel's death, she remarried on 7 September 1670 with Cornelis (van) Foreest, son of Christiaen Foreest (Jaarboek C.B.G. 27(1973), pp. 72-3). On 27 August 1613, Maria van Hengel, the daughter of Joris van Hengel and Katharina Martens (daughter of Hans Martens and of Maycken Bachers), was baptized in the presence of Everhard Becker (Jaarboek C.B.G. 6(1943), p. 206). Everhard Becker was the father of Samuel Becker of R 20466. In view of the presence of Everhard Becker at the above-cited baptism, it appears that the Bacher and the Becker families were probably related (and may once have been identical). Note that Hermannus Martens, one of the two painters who were called in to inventorize the paintings was probably not of the family of Hans Martens, the father-in-law of Stephanus Bacher. On 12 October 1635, he was said to be a goldsmith and the oldest  son of a goldsmith; in 1650, he was said to be one of the headmen of the goldsmiths' guild (Van Dillen, Bronnen tot de geschiedenis van het bedrijfsleven R.G.P. 144(1974),  pp. 96 and 550).","Inventaris ende taxatie van den huijsraet, meubelen ende anders van Doctor Stephanus Bacher, getaxeert by Aeltgen Claes ende Engel Jacobs, gesworen schatsers, die ... verclaren oprecht ... te hebben, Beschreven by my Jan Warnaerts, Not.

He was first noted in Amsterdam in 1588 when he bought the house Texel in the Warmoesstraat from the merchant and leather dealer Siewert Meynertsz. of R 21630 of Montias2  (Kam, Waar was dat huis in de Warmoesstraat? 36/5). His son Johannes (of R 23553) was born in Amsterdam about 1599. Abraham Spiers  was active as a silk cloth dealer in the Warmoesstraat in his house de Roode Camel (perhaps the old Texel). He was a director of the W.I.C. in 1630 (Johannes van Laten, History of the W.I.C., typescript) He assisted his son Johannes on the occasion of his betrothal to Judith van Buren, 20, who was herself   assisted by her father the wine merchant Reyer van Buren, on 31 December 1631 (DTB 438/181). Abraham Spaers (probably a misspelling or an error in transcription for Spiers), living in the Warmoesstraat, paid a tax of 350 f. in 1631 (Kohier, fol. 143vo, p. 33). On 15 May 1636, Hans de Witte and Anna Spiers, man and wife, declared that the capital sum of 5,000 f. that her father Sr. Abraham Spiers had promised  for the marriage of her daughter Anne de Wit with Hendrick de Beijer had been accompanied with his urgent request that the sum promised should be deducted from the inheritance which she, Anna Spiers, had received from her mother Anna Sprenckhuysen (NA 843, fol. 1127, Not. Hogeboom). Abraham Spiers must have died between 1636 and January 1639, the date of  the present inventory. On 25-26 April 1640, Pieter Haen II (cited in R 35 of Montias1),  (merchant), Franck van der Does (of R 29672 of Montias2), and Cornelis Leschevin were cited as curators of the estate of Abraham Spiers. His son Johannes was cited as an heir. There was apparently a dispute about the estate (25-26 April, NA 421, fol. 358,  Notary  Jacob Jacobsz.) Pieter Pietersz. Bos (of R 26353) was married to Lobbetje Abrahams Spiers, the daughter of Abraham Spiers.  The presence in the inventory of a print of the Synod (of 1618) suggests that Abraham Spiers was Reformed.","Inventaris van de goederen bevonden ten huyse van Abraham Spiers, Beschreven ... ten versoecke van de churateuren ... geordoneert over de boedel van Abraham Spiers, en syn geweest als volcht, den vierde january [1639].

The son was probably Huybert van Eyl cited below.   Jeuriaen Huybertsz. committed himself to supply 66,000 f. for his children's share and Joachim van Leyen 6,000 f.

She was betrothed to Albert Dircx Emaus, captain of a vendel of infantry (voetknechten) on 19 July 1602. The son of Dirck Emaus and Aef Pieters, he was widower of Jannetje Joosten. He was apparently the brother of Pieter Dirks Emaus (not Emans), who was a regent of the Tuchthuis from 1619 to 1647 (Blankert, Historisch Museum, p.401). The half sister of Cornelia van Soutelande,  named Maria van Soutelande, born in The Hague about 1557, and buried in Amsterdam on 30 August 1628, was betrothed to Mr. Jacob Simonsz.  van der Does on 25 July 1587 (Jaarboek C.B.G. 19(1965), p. 156). Jacob Simonsz. van der Does was the father of Simon Jacobsz. van der Does, secretary of the Insurance Chamber, who married Beatrix Anselmo in 1594 (see the NOTES to R 28462 of Montias2). Magdalena van Soutelande, the sister of Cornelia cited in the INTRO, is not mentioned among the siblings of Cornelia in the article in the C.B.G. Jaarboek.  Mayken Bultel, also cited in the INTRO, was married to Schout Simon Willemsz. van der Does, who died in 1652. On 12 November 1637, Jan (Hans) Bultel, 5(?), and Adriaen Braems (of R 25313), 36, declared at the request of Franck and Symon (Jacobsz.) van der Does that, at the time the 200th penning tax was levied in 1635, Symon van der Does Jacobsz. had more debts than assets and could not pay the tax and that he had obtained no more as his share in the ineritance from Captain Emaus and his widow (Cornelia Soutelande) than 700 f. minus 200 f. that he owed to the estate (NA 696A, film 4982). Mayken Bultel was almost certainly the sister of the witness in the foregoing deposition Jan (Hans) Bultel.  Neither Philips Sandra nor his wife, whose name is partly illegible, has been identified.","Inventaris van de goederen, huysraet, clederen ende anders nagelaten ende metter doot ontruymt by Cornelia van Soutelande, weduwe van Captain Elbert Dirxsz.

Carel Heughelaen, cited in the POSTSCRIPT to the present inventory, was the father of Mathijs van Ceulen's wife Margaret van Heuchelaen. Since he was said to be the grandfather of the naegelatenen kinderen, it may be inferred that Margaret had died shortly before the inventory was taken and that the inventory was taken in the wake of her death. On 17 March 1632, Matys van Ceulen, merchant, presented his four children before the Orphan Chamber, namely, Maria, 8, Margareta, 5, Agnes, 7(?), and Abraham, 3, whose late mother was Margrieta Heuchlers. He brought 9,600 f. for their mother's inheritance (WK 5073/789). Mathijs van Ceulen may also have had the inventory drawn up in anticipation of his voyage to Pernambuco the next year. Casper Engelbrechtsz., merchant, who supervised the inventory, was the father of Simon Engelbrechtsz. of R 35368 of Montias2.  It is remarkable that, when Mathijs van Ceulen's death inventory was taken in 1644, his household possessions were not only much more valuable (4827 f. versus 2924 f.) but the value of the works of art were now 9-fold larger (unless, of course, the present inventory represented only the goods that Mathijs had brought to the marriage, which we cannot tell in view of the truncated INTRO). In either case, it would appear that he collected art mainly in the later years of his life.","Op huijden den elfden dagh octobris 1631 heb ick Jan Bosch openbaer notaris etc.. ter presentie van de getuygen hiernaer genoemt ten versoeck van Matijs van Ceulen bewinthebber van de W.I.C. ter camer binnen deser stede to deselfs huys [...] in de Spinhuysstraet geinventariseert de naervolgnde meubelen, Beginnende van de Groote Camer die oock datelyck by de twee naergenoemde gesworen schatsers gewaerdert syn als volcht [marginal notation: Mitsgaders by Aeltge Claes ende Engel Jacobs gesworene schatsers gepriseert].

The following betrothals refer to the surgeon.  On 24 March 1626, Andries Cuilert, from Hasselt, widower of Geertruy Snellen, living in Zwoll, where the banns were also to be proclaimed, was betrothed to Maritje van Neck, no living parents, assisted by her acquaintance Grietie Thijssen (DTB 670/135). On 30 November 1630, Andries Cuylaert, along with a number of wine dealers and wine distributors, was insinuated. He was living at the time near the Niselsluijs (NA 910, film 1146, Not. Eyloff).  On 26 October 1632, Andries Keijlert, widower of Marrij Claes van Neck, living in Zwolle, surgeon, was betrothed to Margriet Hoekemans van Toornhout, widow of Hans Marijn, living behind the O.K. (DTB 672/156). Hans Marijn, like Keijlert, was a wine distributor, which makes it less improbable that the surgeon became a wine dealer himself. The following documents surely refer to wine dealer (and possibly former surgeon). On 1 August 1634, a few months after the present transfer of household goods in lieu of house rents took place, Andries Keijlert married Maria Boelis, the daughter of the procureur Hendrick Boelisz., whom he named to represent him in his absence on 1 August 1634, a few months after the present transfer took place (NA 991, fol. 38, Not. J. Bosch). On 18 November 1634, Willemtje Jans, 57, the former  servant maid of the late Hendrick Boelens, procuror, declared at the request of Andries Boelens that she had heard the producent (Andries Boelens), who was going to Copenhague, that he was owed a certain sum of money by Andries Kuylaert and that he did not know how he would obtain payment (NA 843, fol. 773). Andries Cuijlaert, wine distributor, born about 1598, lived first near the Papenbrug, later on the Egelantiersgracht (De Navorscher 93(1952), p.22)). On [...] February 1638, two witnesses whose names were left blank, testified at the request of Jean Sauvage, that they had met Andries Coelaers on February 13 last talking to the requirant (Sauvage) by the beurse (the stock market). Coelaers (Cuilaert) had asked whether he (Sauvage) would take some wines for which his master Juriaen Huijbertsz. (the wine dealer cited in R 178 of Montias 1) had made a bid. Sauvage answered that he would not. Whereupon they parted (NA 952, Not. B. Baddel).   On 20 November 1638, Cuylaert transferred to Jan van Baerle II of R 20427 an obligation with a face value of 947 f. issued by Laurens Gillisz. in Bergen in Norway (NA 1498, Not. Oly). Cuylaert is known to have had two sons and a daughter.  The painter Pieter Cuylaert, born about 1627, lived  at first on the Rozengracht, later on the Elandsgracht. He married Margreta ter Burgh, born in Amsterdam about 1640, on 1 September 1663. He was buried in the N.K. on 21 November 1671. Like his father, he had money troubles. A first inventory was taken of his movable goods  in the wake of his arrest for a debt of 274 f. on 18 June 1668  (INVNO 1331). A second inventory was taken after he became insolvent again (owing to a debt for house rent!) on 26 February 1672 (Bredius, KÃ¼nstler-inventare vol. 3, p.943). Andries's second son was Hendrick Andriesse Cuijlaert. On 7 February 1658, Hendrick Andriesse Cuylaert, from Amsterdam, 26, broker, assisted by his aunt Grietie Roelofs, living on the Blomgracht, was betrothed to Maria Hendricx, 22, no living parents, living on the Princengracht (DTB 684/13). Hendrick Andriessen  was admitted  as a broker in 1650. The daughter of Andries Cuylaert, named Christina Kuylaert, born in 1642/43, married Johannes Westerhout, diamond polisher, on 2 August 1671 (De Navorscher, loc. cit.) Nanning Cornelisz. II, cited in the INTRO, may be identical with the individual of that name, who sometimes used the last name Neutecooper, was the brother-in-law of Hans Mathijsz. Snoeck  (see the NOTES to R 21311 and 32516 of Montias2).","Op huyden den 14en maert 1634 heb ick ondergeteyckent [Nanning Cornelisz.] ontfangen uyt handen van Andries Cuijlert in volle betalinge van twee jaren verlopen huyshuijr ende opgestelde schattinge van de penningen verschene op may 1633 ende 1634 dese naervolgende goederen te weten.

In 1631, Pieter Jaquemuets, who is probably identical with Pieter Jacquemyn, cited in the INTRO,  the father of the late Grietge Jacomyns, living in the Passeerdersgracht on the N.Z. near the fortification, paid a tax of 5 f.
